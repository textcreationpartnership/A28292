            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THoſe that know my Relation to you, the Intereſt that you have in this place, and thoſe Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations, which your Kindneſſes to my ſelf and Family, have laid upon me, will not wonder at the Dedication of my firſt fruits of Printing to you. You were the Inſtruments (under God) of my removal from a forraign County to this place, where moſt of theſe Sermons (which are now expoſed to publick view) were preached: Under your Patronage and Wing, have I now lived (for the ſpace of above ten years, in many re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects) a comfortable, and pleaſurable life.
<pb facs="tcp:62437:3"/>For here I have enjoyed a large oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of Preaching, in ſeaſon, and out of ſeaſon, the glad tidings of Peace, and the Goſpel of Salvation. For (through Grace) I can ſay it, that I prize my Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty (in this reſpect) above the Living, and my Work (though hard to fleſh and bloud) above any worldly advantage. Here I have ſeen the goings of God, yea, power and glory in the Sanctuary. Here ſome have been enlightned, convinced, and awakened out of a dead ſleep; and others ſtrengthened to run the Chriſtian Race, that is ſet before them. Here are broken Reeds, and ſmoaking Flax; yea, here are ſome newly planted in the houſe of the Lord, who (I hope) will flouriſh in the Courts of our God. So that I make no queſtion, but many do at this day, ſound forth the praiſes of God, for guiding and diſpoſing of your Heart, to take care of this great place. You opened the door, and the Lord hath made it effectual. You ſent an Earthen Veſſel hither, and the excellency of the power hath been of God, let him have all the glory. <hi>Not unto us, not unto us; But unto thy Name, O Lord, be the praiſe.</hi> But, O dear Sir, Do you account it your Honour to be uſed ſtill as an Inſtrument
<pb facs="tcp:62437:3"/>(under God) of doing good, and of being made ſerviceable to his Church, in your Stations; that the Children unborn may bleſs the Lord for you. This is the way to eternize your Name, to draw down Heavens bleſſing upon your Perſon and Eſtate; yea, to attain the happineſs, and comfort of Soul-raviſhing ſmiles, from the well-pleaſed face of the great Majeſty of Heaven. Go on and proſper, let your laſt works be as good, if not bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then your firſt; and in all, encourage your ſelf in the Lord your God. My firſt Subject now Printed, tells you, that when your Fleſh and Heart fails you, God will be your ſtrength; and I hope your own experience bears witneſs thereunto. That truſt that was committed to you, when you was made High Sheriff of the County of <hi>Suffolk:</hi> The great loſs that you ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtained by the Fire, in the Metropolis of our Nation, together with other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable loſſes, and charges at the ſame time, did require a more then ordinary influence for your ſupport and relief: But I am well aſſured, that the chearful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of your Countenance, and wiſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of your Affairs, under thoſe heavie preſſures and burdens, ſpeak forth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb facs="tcp:62437:4"/>leſs then a divine ſupport, and ſeaſonable relief. But to my Labours upon <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73.26. I have added that Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon which I preached upon your requeſt at the Aſſizes holden at <hi>Bury</hi> St. <hi>Edmunds, March</hi> 27. 1669. And all I do now de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate to you, as a Teſtimony of my thankfulneſs for thoſe many Kindneſſes, which you have conferr'd upon me. However, by this Inſcription, the Book is become yours, with this humble and hearty deſire, that it may not only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive grace and favour from you, but that by your diligent peruſal thereof, you may receive Grace from it. So prayes</p>

            <p>
               <hi>I</hi> Would be ſorry the luxuriancy of the Preſs, ſhould cloy thy Stomack, to take off thy Eye from a through review of this profitable Treatiſe, here commended to thee: The Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend Author whereof, did not calculate the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt part of it, for any other Meridian then his own Paſtoral charge; and there it had lien without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing it to the Cenſure of critical eyes, had not the importunity of Friends prevailed ſo far with him, as to afford it a Midwife to bring it into the world. I had the happy advantage to be an Auditor of ſome of the Sermons, wherein I obſerved ſuch Spiritual Solidity, that what I then wiſhed, I now obtain; the publication of ſuch elaborate exerciſes, for the common good. I am not ignorant of the bleſſing of a Pulpit Diſpenſation, accompanied with the guſts and gales of Gods Spirit: Yet it is pity ſuch a Jewel ſhould be a Pendant on the Ear, without the priviledge of a Preſs, to leave an impreſſion
<pb facs="tcp:62437:5"/>upon the Heart; Grapes that have paſt the Preſs, cannot but have a moſt delicious reliſh. Hereby this Reverend Author living near, in the Hearts and Affections of his People, who have given him no ſmall encouragement, by their proficiency under his Miniſtry, may abide with them after his tranſlation hence; and the Name of <hi>Blackerby,</hi> both in his worthy Father and Son, may like a box of Spike<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard, perfume their memorial, when this Servant of God is gone, following his Father to receive a Crown, the reward of his unwearied Work. The Author of this Treatiſe, hath (like his Maſter) been a man acquainted with infirmities, exerciſed divers years, under bodily preſſures, and thereby becomes the more fit by his own experience, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend to a gracious Soul, Divine Relief, in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency of Animal Spirits, and to teach a Soul how to lean upon her Beloved, coming out of the Wilderneſs, <hi>Cant. 8.5.</hi> I have ſeen him divers times in the Pulpit, when he had more need to have been in his Bed, ſeeming to me, reduced almoſt into his Socket, having ſpent his Lamp in giving light to others; yet Divine Relief hath carried him through his Work, with a revival of him, and the Hearts of many under his Charge, ſo as he may ſay with the Apoſtle; <hi>When I am weak, then am I ſtrong, 2</hi> Cor. <hi>12.9. The joy of the Lord being his ſtrength,</hi> Nehem. <hi>8.10.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For his way of Preaching, I am well acquainted with it, he is not ambitious of that which ſome call the Knack of Preaching; to ſtart ſome ſpruce Notion, or crop the flowers of Elegancy. This is not his vein, or ought to be thy work: But his dexterity lies in that which <hi>Luther</hi> terms the right Art of
<pb facs="tcp:62437:5"/>Preaching, to hold forth Jeſus Chriſt, and free Grace in a ſearching way, that his people may learn to ſwim to Heaven in a Goſpel Channel. I dare aſſure thee (Reader) if thou ſhalt peruſe this Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe, not curſorily, but with a ſerious and judicious eye, thou wilt find enough, not only to exerciſe thy Head, but to recreate thy Heart. So as thou mayſt name this Work, as <hi>Lamech</hi> did his Son <hi>Noah,</hi> Gen. <hi>5.29.</hi> This ſhall comfort us concerning the work of our hands, when others are exerciſed (in this Angry Age) in reading of Polemicks, the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of their Animoſities, by reading this Treatiſe, thou mayſt retire, like an <hi>Anima Seperata,</hi> into thy boſom, and view the complexion of thy own Soul, and ſee what need thou haſt of Divine Relief, in all thy Exigencies, and Ark thy ſelf within Gods Pavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion in a cloudy day. I will detain thee (Reader) no longer from ſatiating thy ſelf, with Balm from <hi>Gilead</hi> in the enſuing Work; deſiring the God of Grace and Mercy to bleſs the Labours and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours of his faithful Servant, to the good of many precious Souls in this our <hi>Iſrael.</hi>

            <p>THE Life even of the beſt men is ſhort, the ſtrength of that Life is much ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and the actual emprovement of that ſtrength, muſt be acknowledged to have yet a leſs proportion: The moſt painful and faithful Miniſters of Jeſus Chriſt, while they are ſpeaking unto others, are ſpending themſelves, and when they have ſerved a while, their Generation fall aſleep: But good mens deſires to be ſerviceable to God and his Church, are of a larger meaſure, they exceed their actings, ſtrength and life; as an expreſſion whereof they ſometimes make their Labours ſurvive their Perſons, and give a more permanent exiſtence to their tranſient words, that being dead, they may yet ſpeak, and be read, when not heard, <hi>(Heb. 11.4.)</hi> Haſt thou ſo much charity, as to judge this to be the reaſon, thou haſt, wherewith to excuſe in great meaſure, the common offence of the abound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb facs="tcp:62437:6"/>Preſs. It will be no diſhonour to the many worthy Servants of God in the Goſpel of his Son, whoſe extant works remain to the Church, to relate among their number the Reverend Author of the following Diſcourſes. Though the inſtance of a degenerating poſterity be too many, yet God hath not left himſelf without ſufficient witneſs to prove the faithfulneſs of his holy Covenant, <hi>The Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration of the upright ſhall be bleſſed,</hi> (Pſal. <hi>112.2.</hi>) <hi>The juſt mans children are bleſſed after him,</hi> (Prov. <hi>20.7.</hi>) Mr. <hi>Richard Blackerby,</hi> the Reverend Father of the Author, was none of the leaſt Names in the Church of God, in his Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the powerful and ſucceſsful Inſtrument of the Spirit of God for the ſaving of Souls: To him God gave (what <hi>Abſalom</hi> had not) a Son, even this Son, to keep his Name in remembrance, in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable remembrance, that in a gracious Son, that Divine Word might have its fuller accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to a gracious Father. <hi>The memory of the juſt is bleſſed, (Prov. 10.7.)</hi> We doubt not to ſay, with reſpect to the preſent Age, that he hath been, is, and we hope yet ſhall be a ſingular Bleſſing to a very great Congregation. Conſiderable as for its number, ſo eſpecially for the many ſerious and ſober Chriſtians that are found therein. Over which, after a few years intervening, the provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of God happily placed him, in ſuccceſſion to the Reverend, Learned, Orthodox, Prudent, and Holy <hi>Dr. Young.</hi> Where, by the ſpace of ten years (not without difficulty, through much weakneſs and infirmity of body) by ſound Doctrine, and good Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, he hath ſucceſsfully built upon the happy Foundation, which was before laid. The Neigbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood
<pb facs="tcp:62437:7"/>in the mean time gladly partaking with his own people of his weekly Lectures. Thoſe little things, which ſome ſo zealouſly contend for; as they are not the matter of his Preaching, ſo neither are they matter of difference between him and other good men, therein diſſenting from him.

            <head>TO MY DEAR Pariſhioners, And beloved Neighbours in the Burrough of <hi>Stow-Market,</hi> and <hi>Stow-<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pland.</hi>

               <salute>Gentlemen, and Neighbours.</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Read of a Creature, which Hiſtorians call <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, One days life, dead as ſoon as bred: And certainly that Title may be given to many Sermons, whoſe breeding have coſt more time, then their life amounts to. Several daies for their Conception, ſome conſiderable time for their Birth; but die, as faſt as they are brought forth, at the lips of the Preacher: For as they go in at one Ear of ſome Hearers, they go out at the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. And this (I conceive) is one ground of printing Sermons, that there may be a Reſurrection of the Dead. And that that which made no impreſſion upon the Heart, when tendered to the Ear, may (through Divine Bleſſing) be conveyed to the Mind (by being preſented to the
<pb facs="tcp:62437:8"/>Eye) and take up its lodging, and live there.</p>
            <p>'Tis now many years ſince I preached the Sermons, that have the precedency in this little Piece, which I now offer to your peruſal: And I am afraid, that (as to ſome) they are dead, yea, buried in the grave of forgetfulneſs, and are, as if they had never been preached. Upon this, and ſome other Conſiderations, am I over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, to do that now, which (formerly) I thought, none ſhould ever have had ſuch an influence upon me, as to prevail with me to attempt.</p>
            <p>I have been informed, that the preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of them was very grateful unto ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual pallates; and that doth incourage me to hope, that the Printing, and Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of them, will be ſo too.</p>
            <p>You have them, and the reſt, Printed as they were ſtudied and penn'd, but I cannot ſay, as they were preached. The Matter is the ſame; I, but they may want ſomething of their heat and life; unleſs a diligent reading of them be attended with the Spirit of Life.</p>
            <p>As the Subjects are various, ſo various motives, and impreſſions upon my Spirit, put me upon preaching of them at <hi>Stow.</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:62437:8"/>And in all, I hope, I was under a Divine Conduct. For,</p>
            <p n="1">1. When I perceived my Miniſterial Labours and Employment were neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily augmented, and did exceed my firſt engagement and expectation, my Fleſh and my Heart began to fail: So that I was ready to ſay with the Apoſtle, <hi>Who is ſufficient for theſe things?</hi> and therefore could not fix upon a Text in all the Book of God, more ſuitable then <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73.26. both to my ſelf, and alſo to others, who (at that time) had their failings of Fleſh, and Heart alſo.</p>
            <p n="2">2. When I had experienced the power and preſence of God with me, ſo that the Hearts of many, both in the Town and Countrey, ſeemed to be knit to me upon a Spiritual account; I was then throughly convinced, that it was the Wheel within the Wheel that brought me hither, and therefore made choice of <hi>Ezekiels</hi> Viſion of the Wheels, or the Myſtery of Divine Providence, as a fit Subject to treat of in this place: And afterwards, contracted the chief of the matter (contained in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Sermons) into a narrower compaſs, and preached it in a more eminent place.</p>
            <p>I am not altogether inſenſible, that this
<pb facs="tcp:62437:9"/>precious Liquor broached, and drawn forth in ſtudying and preaching, hath paſſed through an impure Pipe: This Heavenly Treaſure hath been put into an Earthen Veſſel, and therefore may have received ſome hurt and detriment; yea, have a taſte thereof. But I hope, that the ſenſe of your own imperfections, and failures in ſpiritual undertakings (for we are all as an unclean thing, and our Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs as filthy rags) will be an effectual enducement to you, to plead with God on my behalf, that what is mine therein, may be pardoned, and on your own behalf, that what is his, he will ſo own, as to make it powerful upon your Spirits, whilſt you are reading and meditating thereon, in order to your preſent, and eternal ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage.</p>
            <p>I bleſs the Lord for any fruits of my Labours in preaching among you, and if the Lord ſhall pleaſe to lengthen out my Life, to ſee an increaſe thereof by Print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, I ſhall ſay with <hi>David, I will praiſe him yet more and more:</hi> Yea, then I ſhall have gained my end in this New Work, and ſay with the Apoſtle in reference to both. <hi>What is my crown and glory? are not even ye in the preſence of our Lord Jeſus?</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:62437:9"/>However, Gods glory, your ſpiritual ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, and publick ſervice to the Church, being the marks I aim at in this Undertaking. If I ſpend my ſtrength for nought, and in vain at preſent, yet ſurely, my Judgement is with the Lord, and my Work with my God; and when I am rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in my grave, the Seed which hath been ſowing in <hi>Stow</hi> many years, may ſpring up and bring forth a plentiful and glorious harveſt. The Lord grant, that none of you do make it evident at the laſt, that you are either of the number of high-way hearers, thorny-ground, or ſtony-ground hearers. But that you all may be good-ground, fit and prepared to receive the Seed, that God hath yet to ſow among you, by the hands of his ſeeds-men; ſo that though they ſow in tears, yet at laſt, they may reap in joy. As for my ſelf, I ſhall not ceaſe to pray, yea, to beg the prayers of others, that the Goſpel may ſtill run and be glorified among you, that this Son of Light, Glory, and Grace, may never ſet upon you in a cloud, and that your glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous day of Gods viſitation in mercy, may not wind up in a dark, and dreadful night of darkneſs and deſolation.</p>
            <p>I can do no leſs at preſent, then put you
<pb facs="tcp:62437:10"/>in mind of, and publiſh, the kindneſs of God to you, and to my ſelf in you, for that diſtinguiſhing mercy of God, that is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten upon <hi>S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <item>2. That in the ſpace of almoſt eleven years, there hath not been one that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed Godlineſs in the Town, that hath ſeparated from the publick preaching of the Word.</item>

               <item>5. That God hath given you a more then ordinary Spirit of Zeal for his Glory, and of Charity towards the Souls of young ones in the Town: Witneſs the Agreement, and Subſcription of many of you, for the Education of poor Children; and a ſtrict obſervation of the Lords Day.</item>
               <item>6. I muſt not forget your Kindneſs to my ſelf. And that,

            <p>I have often ſaid it, that my Life hath been given in to the Prayers of my people. And let the Reader know, that I account it no ſmall favour and ſmile from Heaven, that I live among a praying people. Though all of them be not, yet many are.</p>

                  <p>THough Divine truth may be clearly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood by Divine revelation, yet the heart of a Chriſtian is then moſt confirmed, and ſettled in the belief thereof, and moſt confident to aſſert it, when he hath had ſome experience of the power and life thereof in himſelf; when he can ſay, I know this by experience. The firſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, and riſe of true faith, and ſound know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge ſpringeth from Divine principles, revealed and explained by the Holy Spirit: but the confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation thereof flows from experiments made, and had of thoſe principles. We need go no further, than this <hi>Pſalm</hi> for a proof hereof. The Prophet (whoever he was) was one that was endued, with a ſaving knowledge of Divine Principles, and with faith therein: I, but the confirmation of his faith, was made by a Divine work, in
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:62437:15"/>which the life, and power of thoſe principles ſhone forth. He did believe, at firſt, that God was good to <hi>Iſrael;</hi> I, but his faith was not ſtrong, and able to overcome an aſſault, and to quench this fiery dart that Satan ſhot at him: until he had found the truth of this principle by experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in himſelf: So you may ſee, <hi>verſ,</hi> 2, 3, 13, 14. Senſe prevails againſt his faith, until ſuch a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine work was wrought in himſelf, as terminated his faith and ſenſe in one object. Now he can, with boldneſs, and great confidence, aſſert, that God is good to <hi>Iſrael, &amp;c.</hi> For he is able to give a demonſtration thereof from his ſenſe, as well as from faith. This you have in the Text, <hi>My fleſh and my heart faileth me, but God is the ſtrength of my heart and my portion for ever. q. d.</hi> I now find it to be true by mine own experience, &amp; I can give a particular demonſtration thereof. God was good to me. I was in a languiſhing &amp; ſinking condition; my ſtrength gone, and my life almoſt gone, the pains of death, and the ſorrows of hell took hold on me, that I was giving up all my hopes for loſt: And then God appeared to me, and revived and ſtrengthened my heart. My caſe was very ſad, and now 'tis as comfortable. My hell is turned in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to an heaven of joy, and comfort. So that in the words you have a two fold experiment brought in to demonſtrate one precious truth. That God is good to <hi>Iſrael,</hi> that is the truth.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The firſt experiment is the Prophets ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lady.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The latter is the Prophets relief.</p>
                  <p>The firſt is brought in to grandize and heighten the other. Had not the Prophets malady been
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:62437:15"/>ſo deſperate, his relief had not appeared ſo glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. The worſe the Prophets ſtate was, the more was Gods goodneſs ſeen, in his relief and help.</p>
                  <p>Let us therefore take a further Surveigh of both,</p>
                  <p>Firſt of the malady, and therein conſider,
<list>
                        <item>1. The nature or kind of it; failing.</item>
                        <item>2. The Subject, wherein it was ſeated; both in the fleſh and in the heart. Failing of the fleſh, notes out a conſumption of the outward man, or a loſs of external ſupports. So we find fleſh taken in Scripture, both properly, for the outward man, or the body of man, when the ſtrength thereof abates, and departs, the bulk, or quantity thereof leſſens, or the beauty and glory thereof fades; and alſo Metaphorically, for the loſs of external priviledges. So <hi>Phil.</hi> 3, 4, Fleſh is taken for all external advantages. Theſe may fail. Failing of the Heart notes out a ſinking or dying. When,
<list>
                              <item>1. The faculties of the ſoul ſink, and cannot perform their due offices; either by way of appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion, election, or retention.</item>
                              <item>2. When the infuſed or acquired habits of the heart are indiſpoſed to act, or are weakened, not only our moral, but our Spiritual habits much abate.</item>
                              <item>3. When the Animal ſpirits are expiring and even breathing forth.</item>
                           </list>
                        </item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>This ſeems to be the Prophets diſeaſe and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lady; he was brought very low, even to the very pit, ready to die; ſoul and body failed, all his powers weakened. When the body is ſmitten, it flies for ſuccour to the heart, (the ſpirit of a man will ſuſtein his infirmities;) but when the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:62437:16"/>heart is ſmitten alſo and that fails him too, the man is done then, he can afford himſelf no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief. Die he muſt, and will, if God comes not in. When communicated ſtrength fails, 'tis time for the man to look abroad, and ſeek for ſtrength in God, or elſe he ſinks, and never riſeth more.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, This is the Prophets relief: God comes in and fetcheth life again; reinſouls him, communicates a new ſupply of ſtrength to him, ſets him upon his feet again; this makes him to ſay as you have it in the Text, <hi>But is the ſtrength of my heart, and my portion for ever,</hi>

                     <hi>the rock of my heart.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In which words we may take notice of five things,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The order inverted. When he mentions his malady, he begins with the failing of the fleſh, and then of the heart: but when he reports the relief, he begins with that of the heart. From hence.</p>
                  <p>Obſerve, <hi>That when God works a cure in man (out of love) he begins with the heart, he cures that first.</hi> And there may be theſe reaſons for it,
<list>
                        <item>1. Becauſe the ſin of the heart is often the procuring cauſe of the malady of body and ſoul.</item>
                        <item>2. The body ever fares the better for the ſoul, but not the ſoul for the body.</item>
                        <item>3. The cure of the ſoul is the principal cure.</item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. The ſuitableneſs of the remedy to the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lady. Strength of heart for failing of heart, and a bleſſed portion for the failing of the fleſh.</p>
                  <p>Obſ. <hi>That there is a proportionate remedy and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:62437:16"/>in God for all maladies and afflictions whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, both within and without. If your hearts fail you, God is ſtrength if your fleſh fails you, or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts fail you, God is a portion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. The Prophets intereſt, he calls God his ſtrength and his portion.</p>
                  <p>Obſ. <hi>That true Iſraelites have an undoubted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in God. He is theirs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. The Prophet's experience in the worſt time. He finds this to be true, that when communicated ſtrength fails, there is a never failing ſtrength in God.</p>
                  <p>Obſ. <hi>That Chriſtians experiences of Gods all-ſufficiency are then fulleſt and higheſt, when created comforts fail them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5. Here is the Prophet's emprovement of his experience, for ſupport and comfort againſt fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture trials and temptations.</p>
                  <p>Obſ. <hi>That a Saints conſideration of his experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of Gods all ſufficiency in times of Exigency, is enough to bear up, and to fortifie his ſpirit, againſt all trials and temptations for the time to come.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus you may emprove the Text by way of Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation; But there are two principal Doctrines to be inſiſted on.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, That God is the Rock of a Saints heart, his ſtrength and his portion for ever.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, That Divine influence and relief paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth from God to his people, when they ſtand in moſt need thereof.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, God is the rock of a Saints heart, ſtrength and portion for ever.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Branch,</hi> 1. God is the rock of a Saints heart, ſtrength. He is not only ſtrength, and the ſtrength of their hearts, but the rock of their ſtrength: ſo <hi>Eſay</hi> 17.10. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 62.7. <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> the ſame word, that is uſed in the Text; from hence comes our Engliſh word <hi>ſure.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Explic.</hi> God is the rock of our ſtrength, both in reſpect of our naturals, and alſo of ſpirituals: he is the ſtrength of nature, and of grace, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 27.1. the ſtrength of my life natural and ſpiritual. God is the ſtrength of thy natural faculties; of reaſon, and underſtanding, of wiſdom and prudence, of will and affections. He is the ſtrength of all thy graces, faith, patience, meekneſs, temperance, hope and charity; both as to their being, and exerciſe. He is the ſtrength of all thy comfort and courage; peace and happineſs; ſalvation and glory. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 140.7. <hi>O God, the rock of my Salvation;</hi> In three reſpects.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, he is the Author and giver of all ſtrength, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 18.2. It is God that girdeth me with ſtrength, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 29.11. he will give ſtrength to his people, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 138.3. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 68.35.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, He is the increaſer and perfecter of a Saints ſtrength: it is God that makes a Saint ſtrong and mighty both to do, and ſuffer, to bear and forbear, to believe and to hope to the end; ſo <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.34. <hi>Out of weakneſs they were made ſtrong:</hi> ſo 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.14. And therefore is that prayer of <hi>Peter,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.10.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, He is the preſerver of your ſtrength;
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:62437:17"/>your life is laid up in God; <hi>Col.</hi> 3.3. your ſtrength is kept by the ſtrength of God; ſo <hi>Pſal</hi> 91.1. God doth overſhadow the ſtrength of Saints, that no breach can be made upon it; <hi>Pſal.</hi> 63.7. <hi>In the ſhadow of thy wings will I truſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now for Demonſtration, I ſhall lay down ſix poſitions.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. All ſtrength is in God originally, and fully. God is the firſt ſtrength, and the fountain of ſtrength; He is the root &amp; ſpring of ſtrength; He is all ſtrength in himſelf; He is wiſdom it ſelf, and light it ſelf, and life it ſelf, and grace it ſelf. <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> ſignifies ſometimes the Original Fountain of things; and God is called ſo, becauſe he is the beginning and efficient cauſe of all things, out of himſelf, thus <hi>Schindler.</hi> The ſtrength of a Saint is but a drop in the bucket, a beam of the Sun, a ſpark of fire in compariſon of God. He alone is all. Whatever is in the creature is eminently in God; 'tis much more in him. Hence is that Character, which God gives of himſelf to <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, Gen.</hi> 17.1, <hi>I am the Almighty God:</hi> for this is peculiar unto him; Many beings may be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led ſtrong or mighty; but none may arrogate the title of Almighty but God: 'Tis God that is All-ſufficient both for himſelf, and for all beings be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low himſelf. The ſtream is often low, and yet the ſpring and fountain full and high. The ſtrength of the creature may fail; but the ſtrength of God never fails. 'Tis fully in God, when 'tis not in us. Life may go out of the branch, and yet remain in the root; This is the happineſs of Gods people, that though they have little in themſelves,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:62437:18"/>they have enough in God. <hi>Bleſſed is the man whoſe ſtrength is in thee, Pſal.</hi> 84.5. For when com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated ſtrength is ſpent, yet there is an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicated fullneſs ſtill in God. They may ſay, as the prodigal, when he had ſpent his por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; <hi>in my fathers houſe, there is bread enough, and to ſpare.</hi> My light is gone, and my life fails, and my grace fails, and I am reduced to a ſad condition in my ſelf: I, but there is enough in God; there is light enough, and life enough, and grace enough; God is All ſtill, even when I am nothing. I may allude to the ſtory of <hi>Hagar; Gen.</hi> 21.15, <hi>to the</hi> 19. <hi>When the water was ſpent in her bottle, God opened her eyes, and ſhe ſaw a well of water;</hi> So when your bottles are all empty, if God do but open your eyes, ſo as to behold him, you will ſee a well, a fountain of all ſtrength.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The <hi>Iſrael</hi> of God, Gods choſen and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved ones in Chriſt, have a peculiar intereſt in the ſtrength of God; the ſtrength of God is their ſtrength; ſo the Prophet ſaith, <hi>God is my ſtrength.</hi> As when Jehoſhaphat made a Covenant with <hi>Ahab,</hi> to go with him to <hi>Ramoth-Gilead,</hi> he tells him that all he was and had was <hi>Ahabs,</hi> 2 <hi>Chro.</hi> 18.3, <hi>I am as thou art, and my people as thy people, and my horſes as thine, i. e.</hi> he reſerved nothing peculiar to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, but gave <hi>Ahab</hi> an intereſt in all: ſo doth God, he reſerves nothing peculiar to himſelf, but his honour and glory (which he cannot give to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther), but gives his people an intereſt in all. All the ſtrength of God, is made over to the people of God. God hath nothing, but what they have an intereſt in. Whenever God ſpeaks to a ſoul, as
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:62437:18"/>he did to <hi>Abraham, I will be thy God,</hi> at that time, God paſſeth and maketh over himſelf to it: and now, that ſoul hath a peculiar intereſt in God; the ſtrength the All-ſufficiency of God is that mans, the wiſdom of God, the holineſs of God, the mercy of God, the will of God, is his, that heighth, and depth, that length and breadth of ſtrength that is in God, is a Saints. When he reads the Scripture, and there finds what riches of ſtrength there is in God, and through the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of light is able to conceive very largely of God. he may then ſay within himſelf All this is mine, All that God is, is mine. When Saints go to God for ſtrength, either of nature, or of grace, they do not go as meer beggars, but as children go to a father, in whom they have an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, and in all that he hath, and may with boldneſs plead their intereſt therein: a moſt full place you have in <hi>Eſay</hi> 63.15, 16. &amp; <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.94. And ſo when God gives forth himſelf to Saints, he doth it, not as ſome great man gives <hi>boons</hi> to all commers to expreſs his bounty: but as a father gives peculiar gifts to his children; ſo <hi>Eſay</hi> 43.1, 2, 3, 4.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. According to the Saints Communion with God and God's influence into them, ſuch is their ſtrength. Divine incomes give ſtrength, and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it. When God takes up his dwelling in the heart, it becomes ſtrong and mighty: never be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. We may ſay of men, that are at a diſtance from God, as the Prophet <hi>Hoſea to Ephraim, how weak is thine heart?</hi> but of Saints, as <hi>Paul</hi> of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, <hi>when I am weak, then am I ſtrong.</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.10. <hi>Paul</hi> had cloſe Communion with God and Chriſt,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:62437:19"/>and now the power of Divine grace reſted upon him, and took up his reſidence in him, to ſtrength him. The nearer the ſoul comes to God, and the more it enjoys of God, the ſtronger it is: a man full of God, is a man full of ſtrength; ſo you may ſee, <hi>Micah,</hi> 3.8, but truly <hi>I am full of power by the Spirit of God:</hi> the Spirit of God was poured forth upon the Prophet, and this filled him full of power. The Diſciples of Chriſt were weak, and therefore Chriſt promiſeth to baptize them with the Holy Ghoſt, and with power; now they are able and ſtrong. Even as when the Prophet <hi>Elias had been fed by the Raven he went in the ſtrength thereof forty days,</hi> 1 <hi>King.</hi> 19.8. So when the ſoul hath fed it ſelf upon Divine influence, it walks in the ſtrength thereof. It is not here, as with the lean kine of <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> that devour all the fat, and yet never the better, <hi>for they that wait upon the Lord, ſhall renew their ſtrength, Eſay</hi> 40.31. God never lets that ſoul depart without this bleſſing, that waits upon him. I dare appeal to any expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rimental Chriſtian for a witneſs hereunto. Hear what <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith, <hi>Prov.</hi> 10.29, <hi>The way of the Lord is ſtrength to the upright;</hi> And alſo what <hi>David</hi> ſaith, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 27.14, <hi>Wait on the Lord, and he ſhall ſtrengthen thy heart: wait, I ſay, on the Lord.</hi> This is that, which makes a diſparity between one Chriſtian and another: yea, between a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian at one time and at another. What makes one Chriſtian ſtronger then another, but the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes of God? one enjoys more of God, then another: one hath more Communion with God, then another: one receives more from God, then another. And hence it is, that one can do that
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:62437:19"/>which another can't, and one can ſuffer that, which another can't; one goeth heavily and drooping under his burden, when another ſings, and is merry with a burden that is far heavier; One can ſlight a temptation, and reſiſt it, allthough it be very great, and another is over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, when it is ſmall. <hi>I</hi>'le give you ſome Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples hereof.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Compare the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> with the ſecond; the firſt was ſuddenly overcome with a temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and fell from a ſtate of happineſs, into a ſtate of miſery, becauſe he had not Divine influence to ſupport him, and keep him from falling; his ſtrength was placed in himſelf, and not in God. But the ſecond <hi>Adam</hi> ſtands his ground, and keeps the field, againſt Satans ſtrongeſt attempts and batteries; yea, beats him with his own weapon, and forces him to retreat; becauſe the God-head dwelt bodily in him: and in him dwelt all ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
                  <p>Again, Compare <hi>Lot</hi> and his wife, with <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> in point of trial; when God would have <hi>Lot</hi> and his wife deny themſelves, and leave their pleaſant habitation (of which it is ſaid, that it was even as the garden of the Lord) you ſhall find, <hi>Gen.</hi> 19.16, that <hi>Lot</hi> and his wife, were loth to obey God herein; 'tis ſaid <hi>he lingred, &amp;c.</hi> But now when God tried <hi>Abraham</hi> in a far greater matter, ſee how willingly he obeyed God therein: ſo you may ſee, <hi>Gen.</hi> 22. <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.20.</p>
                  <p>The ſtrength of a Chriſtian lies not ſo much in his inherent Principles, as in his aſſiſting influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences: a Chriſtian is ſtrong as they flow in. As a child, in his fathers hand, may do that, which one of larger growth cannot do of himſelf; ſo a
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:62437:20"/>young Chriſtian in the hand of Chriſt, can do that which old <hi>Adam</hi> could not do in innocency, when left to himſelf. A weak bearer with ſtrong ſupporters, may hold a greater weight, than a ſtronger bearer without ſupporters. A weak Chriſtian underpropt and upheld by Divine ſtrength, may undergo and bear more, then one that hath a larger meaſure of inherent grace. This is that which makes a Chriſtian differ from himſelf: at one time very weak, and at another time very ſtrong; as buds open in the day, and ſhut at night, as a man faſting, and full differs in ſtrength. We ſee <hi>David,</hi> at one time, is afraid of a little,<note place="margin">1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 27.1. 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 30.6.</note> and at another time fears nothing. At one time he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes, that one day he ſhall pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh by the hand of <hi>Saul,</hi> and yet not near him; at another time, when his own people ſpake of ſtoning him, he takes courage in the Lord his God. An army of flies will terrifie a Chriſtian at one time, when as an army of Giants can't daunt him at another. Sometimes he can do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, at other times he can do all things. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times he doth but creep, at another he runs to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards heaven. Full is that <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.19, <hi>we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve according to the working of his mighty power,</hi> much or little; a little power put forth will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce but a little faith, a great power will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce a great faith. So that this is clear, that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to a Saints Communion with God, and Gods influence into him, ſuch is his ſtrength: as a man receives from God, ſuch is his power and abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity: the whole ſtrength of a Chriſtians heart de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends upon the enjoyment of God.</p>
                  <pb n="13" facs="tcp:62437:20"/>
                  <p n="4">4. According to the fulneſs and extent of grace promiſed in the Covenant of grace, ſuch is Gods influence into the hearts of his people for their ſtrength. The Covenant of grace is full and large, proportioned to the eternal love of God, and the weak ſtate of fallen man; So that there is no condition into which a Saint can fall, but there is a proportionate and ſuitable good promiſed and Covenanted to it. The Covenant is Gods diſpenſative, wherein all receits for all Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual weakneſſes is held forth: there is not a heart failing, but there is a receit for it; ſome pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe that is ſuitable thereunto. Now Gods ſtrength paſſeth from God through the word of promiſe. As God ſpeaks the word, ſo Divine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence flows into the ſoul. The words that I ſpeak (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>are ſpirit and life, Joh.</hi> 6.63. The Lord is therefore pleaſed, to ſet forth the power and life of his promiſe by a lively ſimilitude, <hi>Eſay</hi> 55.10, 11, 12, 13. Even as the rain and ſnow gives ſtrength to the earth to bring forth, and to bud, and makes it fruitful: ſo doth the word of grace give ſtrength to a weak heart, to bring forth grace and comfort, and makes it full of goodneſs. <hi>David</hi> had experience of this, and therefore ſaith, In God I will praiſe his word, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 56.4, 10, <hi>i. e.</hi> This is my ſtrength; God ſpeaks the word and it is done: comfort and courage, help and ſalvation flows in, through the word of promiſe. Alaſs, I were not able to ſtand, if I had not this ſupporter to bear me up. So you may ſee, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 21.13, I had fainted unleſs I had believed. God doth not only ſtrengthen his Saints, according to his word, but he ſtrengthens them by his word.
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:62437:21"/>This is the medium through which all Divine ſtrength paſſeth into the hearts of Saints: for the ſtrength of God is in his word of promiſe, as its proper life and virtue; this makes it enlightening, enlivening, ſtrengthening, encouraging, comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and ſanctifying; Hence is that of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle <hi>Peter,</hi> 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.3, 4. He that takes hold on the Covenant, and on the promiſes of grace there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, takes hold of Divine ſtrength, and (as it is ſaid of <hi>Sarah</hi>) <hi>ſhall receive ſtrength to conceive, and to bring forth the image, and life of God in his ſoul and converſation.</hi> When God ſeemeth to ſtand at a diſtance from the ſoul, that ſhe can't ſee him, nor find him out: yet if the word of promiſe be nigh her and in her, ſhe can't want ſtrength, for the ſtrength of God is in it; and have you not found it thus ſometimes? that upon the reading, or hearing of a gratious promiſe of God, held forth in the Scripture, ſuch a clear light hath ſhined into your ſouls, and ſuch a ſtrength hath flowed in therewith, as to raiſe you up, and to work a mighty change in you.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. According to that mutual tranſact that is between God the Father, and his Son Chriſt Jeſus, both on Gods part, and on the believers part, ſo doth the Covenant give forth its virtue and grace to the believer. You heard before, that the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of grace is Gods means, whereby he ſtrengthens his people; there is the ſtrength of God laid out: now this means works not but as it is moved; it gives forth nothing but as it is ſet on work. Though there were healing, and ſtrengthening virtues in the pool of <hi>Betheſda,</hi> yet they could not put forth themſelves, until the
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:62437:21"/>Angel moved the waters: ſo it is here, the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of grace is Gods ſtrengthening pool: I, but the virtue thereof is not put forth, without a motion; theſe waters are ſet on work by a mutual tranſact between the Father and the Son.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Therefore God the Father takes the poor ſinner, and puts him into the hands of Chriſt; and ſaith thus to him: Son take this poor wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſinner into thine own hands, for I cannot look upon him in himſelf, I can do nothing for him, as he ſtands upon his own carnal bottome: he is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done, weak, and wretched, and ſo he muſt abide without any help, unleſs thou doſt bottome him upon thy ſelf, and hide him under the robe of thy righteouſneſs. I can't hear his prayers, nor own his deſires, nor pitty his groans, unleſs they be all perſumed with the odour of thine incenſe, and preſented to me by thy hand. The Covenant of grace, and the promiſes of grace are all made in thee, and muſt be performed in thee, and therefore he can have no benefit by them, until thou haſt an actual poſſeſſion of him: he muſt be thine, or elſe they can't be his. Then the Lord Jeſus, takes the poor ſinner, and having ſprinkled him with his blood, and waſhed him from all his guilt, hides him in his own robes, and preſents him to the Father, as an object of pitty and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy. And after this manner mediates and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds with his Father, on the ſinners behalf, Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Father, here is one whom thou haſt given me, for whom I have ſhed my heart blood, that I might make ſatisfaction to Divine Juſtice, for all offences committed by him againſt thee, and
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:62437:22"/>purchaſe all that grace, that is in the Covenant for him: he ſtands not upon his own account, but upon mine: I am touched with the feeling of his infirmities, his weakneſs and griefs are mine, his troubles and pains are mine, his faintings and failings are mine, his tears and cries are mine, his prayers and deſires are mine: here I tender them to thee in mine own name, and beg thine audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and acceptance of them: my ſufferings and my blood ſhed for him cries to thee: yea, thine own Covenant, ratified and confirmed with thine own oath, cries to thee for mercy and grace to help and ſtrengthen him. Now hereupon, the bowels of grace and mercy earns and melts over a poor diſtreſſed ſinner, and like the great wheel in the Clock, ſets all the leſſer wheels a going by its motion; So the grace of God ſets the Covenant of grace on work, that it may give forth its virtue and ſtrength to the ſoul.</p>
                  <p>This glorious myſtery will be beſt underſtood and cleared to you by ſeveral ſteps.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That God the Father is the firſt mover in this great buſineſs. He firſt loves; and then gives ſouls to Chriſt, 1 <hi>John</hi> 4.19. <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.13. There is a two fold giving of ſouls to Chriſt.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. By way of Covenant deſignation or decree made in heaven between the Father and the Son, in which God made over all his elect to Chriſt, and Chriſt undertook to bear their names. So <hi>Joh.</hi> 10.29. In this place he doth not only ſpeak of thoſe that did at the preſent believe, but of all others that ſhould believe. So <hi>verſ.</hi> 16.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. By way of actual poſſeſſion, and ſo God
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:62437:22"/>gives ſouls to Chriſt, as his manſion to dwell in. This is the Fathers work, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.44. <hi>No man can come to me except the Father draw him;</hi> When God doth draw a man to Chriſt, then he gives him to Chriſt for his actual poſſeſſion.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Gods deſign in giving ſouls to Chriſt, is that they may be put into a capacity for relief; for of themſelves they are not. Out of Chriſt they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not come to God, there is no immediate acceſs to God; His firſt giving them to Chriſt by way of deſignation was for ſatisfaction; but this latter giving them to Chriſt is for application, that they may reap and enjoy the benefit of his ſatisfaction; that through Chriſt they might have acceſs to God, and an entrance into the grace of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant; and therefore did <hi>Paul</hi> ſo earneſtly deſire that he might be found in Chriſt.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The whole Covenant of grace with all the promiſes therein are founded in Chriſt, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed unto none but the choſen of God in Chriſt, and ſuch as are given to Chriſt. Hence is that of the Apoſtle, 2 <hi>Corinth.</hi> 1.20. <hi>Acts</hi> 2.39.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The Lord Jeſus owns every ſinner that is given to him by the Father as his peculiar truſt; He becomes their ſhepheard, and takes the care of them, and never leaves them, until he hath brought them into actual poſſeſſion and fruition of all Covenanting grace; You have this fully ſet forth, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.11, 12, 17, 18, with 4.15.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Having taken this truſt upon him, and made it his buſineſs, he mediates with the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for them, that the Covenant of grace,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:62437:23"/>with all the promiſes may be performed to them, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.25.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. The Covenant being pleaded by Chriſt with the Father, muſt be performed to the ſinner. God can't in juſtice deny it; this treaſury and ſtore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe of grace is preſently opened, for the ſoul to come and receive grace and ſtrength; moſt full is that, <hi>John</hi> 14.12, 13, 14. &amp; <hi>John</hi> 16.24.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. According to the Spirits Revelation of this grace in the heart, ſuch is our ſenſe and feeling thereof; and according to our ſenſe thereof, ſuch is our comfort. Divine Revelation gives us the ſenſe of Spiritual incomes and influences, and a true ſenſe thereof gives us comfort; the larger the diſcovery is, the larger is our ſenſe and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort. There is many a gratious ſoul that wants the ſtrength of comfort, and yet doth not want the ſtrength of grace and holineſs, and the reaſon is, becauſe he hath not the ſenſe and feeling of his grace. This therefore is the office of the Spirit to reveal, and make known thoſe incomes, and Divine influences which the ſoul enjoys of and from God, for his ſtrength and ſupport; As you may ſee, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.10, 12. The ſpirit reveals all ſpiritual gifts to the ſouls of his Saints, that they may know them, and have the ſenſe and feeling of them in their hearts. And hence he is called the comforter, becauſe he reveals that to the ſoul which is matter of comfort. For it is the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and ſenſe of things that adminiſters com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort; To be without a good, and not to know it, is all one in point of comfort; As what com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort doth any eſtate afford a man when he is igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:62437:23"/>of his intereſt in it, and enjoyment of it. If a man have a rich Mine of Gold and Silver in any part of his lands, and yet knows not of it, it is nothing to him. So if a man have never ſuch a meaſure of gifts and graces from God, yet if he be ſtill in the dark, and know it not, he can take no comfort therein. So long as a ſoul queſtions and is in doubt about his ſpiritual eſtate, he can't have comfort; and therefore the holy Spirit comes, and makes it known to the people of God, that they may have true comfort.</p>
                  <p>Uſe. <hi>If God be the rock of a Chriſtians heart ſtrength.</hi> Then this may ſerve for counſel and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction to all true <hi>Iſraelites.</hi>

                  </list>
                  <p>Firſt, To account God your ſtrength; He is ſo in truth, let him be ſo in your account. Own, and acknowledge God to be your ſtrength alone. It is a Saints great priviledge that God is his ſtrength, and it is his duty to account him ſo. A Chriſtian ſhould live in the ſenſe and feeling of this truth, in the power and life of it. The notion of it is of little advantage, but the ſenſe thereof is of great uſe to a Chriſtian. And that,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. In point of ſettlement and quiet: this is a ſure bottom for thy ſoul to ſtay upon at all times; The ſoul is like the trembling needle, that cannot ſtand ſtill, but is ever in motion, and in fear, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til it is directed to God its North-pole. When a man accounts of any thing elſe as his ſtrength, he puts himſelf into a trembling poſture: he cannot ſix himſelf, but is toſſed to and fro with fears
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:62437:24"/>and doubts. But now, let him fix his eye upon God, as the rock of his ſtrength, and then he is quiet and at reſt, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 16.8, 9. Soul trouble ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth from two things principally, the loſs of God, or the neglect of, and non-emproving God: if God be either at a diſtance from us, or if we do not ſet him before us, and keep him in our eye. Now he that doth not fix his eye upon God, by way of acknowledgement, will never fix his heart upon God for ſettlement; and therefore muſt needs be in continual motion, and never quiet. He that is ſtrongeſt in wiſdom, or riches, or friends, or graces, can never ſettle, nor be at quiet in his breaſt, until he fix on God. For none of theſe have an inherent, independant, and eternal ſtrength; the ſtrength of theſe is in God; and if God doth not conveigh ſome new ſupply of ſtrength into them, they will all fail us: and our experience hereof makes a man fear, that at one time or other, he may be at a loſs for ſtrength: if a fit of ſickneſs comes, a mans wiſdom and ſtrength quickly fails him: if an enemy invade the Land, a rich man may quickly be plundred of all, and made poor: and if a Chriſtian be ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized with a temptation, and fall into ſome groſs ſin, how will it waſt and conſume his grace? So that here can be no ſettlement nor quiet. But now, that ſoul that looks at God as his ſtrength, may well be quiet and at reſt. Moſt excellent is that of the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.16, joyned with <hi>Chap.</hi> 5. beg. <hi>for which cauſe we faint not,</hi> 
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>: the word ſignifies to ſhrink back, as cowards in war: they are afraid, and can't ſtand their ground, they can't ſettle themſelves to
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:62437:24"/>fight. Now ſaith the Apoſtle, we do not thus: no, we are ſettled and at quiet, whatever comes; for we look not at things that are ſeen, we look not at a created ſtrength: but at things unſeen; we look to God. What though we muſt break up houſe, and be diſſetled as to our bodily conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: yet we know, that we have a building of God, eternal in the heavens. We have a God to go to, in whom we dwell now, and with whom we ſhall dwell for ever; a Chriſtian that accounts God his ſtrength, is never at a loſs: he can never be diſſetled.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. In point of ſucceſs, account God your ſtrength, and that will carry you out, and bear you up, until you arrive at a happy iſſue of all things. O bleſſed is the man, whoſe ſtrength is in thee: ſaith the Prophet <hi>David,</hi> a bleſſing doth ever attend that man that accounts God his ſtrength: he ſhall never fail of a gratious iſſue: as Divine ſtrength doth accompany that man, ſo Divine bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing doth ever flow from Divine ſtrength. Divine ſtrength is a River of broad waters, now a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian that accounts God his ſtrength, <hi>is like a tree planted by a river of waters, that ever bringeth forth its fruit in due ſeaſon, Pſal.</hi> 1.3. <hi>&amp; Jer.</hi> 17.7, 8. Whatever his ſtate and condition is, and whatever his work and employment is, Divine ſtrength makes it fruitful and ſucceſsful. Many earthly things are ſtrong and barren, but heavenly and Divine ſtrength is never barren. Nay, wherever it is communicated, it makes them fruitful; but eſpecially when the heart is filled with it, and acted by it, the fruits thereof are full and glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. A Chriſtians graces, and his gifts and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:62437:25"/>are like a flock of ſheep, whereof every one beareth twins, and none is barren amongſt them: They all bring forth much fruit unto God and his Church. Yea, whenever a Chriſtian goeth forth in the ſtrength of God to perform any duty that God enjoyns him, his work ſhall flouriſh, and be exceeding ſucceſsful; So <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.33. This leads me ſome particular directions herein, that you may thus own God as your alone ſtrength.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Be diffident of your own ſtrength; go not forth in that, do not lean upon that; this coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel is given us by the Holy Ghoſt; <hi>Prov.</hi> 3.5, 6, 7. Do not ſay, I have ſtrength enough, I can do this or that of my ſelf, my wiſdom, and mine underſtanding, and mine abilities and parts ſhall help and relieve; direct and carry me through: No, this is not to own God as your ſtrength: but to ſet up your ſelf in the room of God, and to make it an Idol. Self ſtrength is given us of God to uſe, but not to be reſted on; for this is a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture from God. <hi>Jer.</hi> 17.5, <hi>Curſed be the man that truſteth in man and maketh fleſh his arm, and whoſe heart departeth from the Lord.</hi> Or as the <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bick</hi> Verſion hath it: <hi>But his heart is removed from the Lord.</hi> O take heed of this,

                  <p>Firſt, When your ſtrength is great in your own eyes, do not rely on it: <hi>But ſtill own God the rock of your ſtrength.</hi> It is a great bleſſing to have inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent ſtrength, for a man to be wiſe, knowing,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:62437:25"/>gratious, to be able to act for God, to mortifie ſin, and to combate with Spiritual adverſaries: but the greater meaſure of inherent ſtrength thou haſt, if reſted in, the nearer it is to a curſe and blaſt. This is certain, that God doth not always ſucceed deſigns undertaken by great ſtrength, and if God doth not aſſiſt them, they will never be effected: but he doth ever frown upon, deſert, curſe and blaſt both the ſtrength and the deſign, when men rely upon it, and truſt to it; let the ſtrength be never ſo great. I will give you ſome notable examples of this out of the Holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures; <hi>Judg.</hi> 10. In this Sacred Hiſtory you have three things very obſerveable. Firſt, <hi>Iſrael</hi> had a good cauſe in hand, as you may read at large, <hi>Chap.</hi> 19. Secondly, <hi>Iſrael</hi> did far exceed the <hi>Benjamites</hi> in ſtrength, for the number of <hi>Iſrael</hi> was 400000 men, and the number of <hi>Benjamin</hi> was but 26000 men. Thirdly, the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> did ask counſel of God about the order of their fight, <hi>verſ.</hi> 18.23. And yet you ſhall find that God did not proſper them, neither in their firſt, nor in their ſecond attempt; but gave victory to the <hi>Benjamites</hi> againſt the men of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> who loſt 40000 in the two battles. Neither did he go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long with the men of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> until he had hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled them, and brought them to a low frame of heart; So you may ſee, <hi>verſ.</hi> 26. 'Tis true, they had enquired of God before: I, but they too much relyed upon their own ſtrength, and God would abaſe that before he gave them deliverance. Many a man will pray, and rely upon his prayer, and not on God: I, But God will not own ſuch a prayer. No, thou muſt be emptied of all ſelf,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:62437:26"/>and make God thine All ſtrength, or elſe God will not own thee. Another example is that of <hi>Abijah,</hi> and <hi>Jeroboam,</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 13.3.16, 17, <hi>Jeroboams</hi> Army was double to <hi>Abijabs;</hi> and yet the victory was given to <hi>Abijah.</hi> A third exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple will drive the nail home to the head, and prove the thing in hand fully. It is that of the Apoſtle <hi>Peter.</hi> He was a man, of all the Diſciples the moſt couragious; and forward to confeſs and own Chriſt at all times: yea, to obey his commands; As you may ſee, <hi>Matt.</hi> 14.28, and ſo <hi>Matt.</hi> 16.15, 16, <hi>Matt.</hi> 17.4. &amp; <hi>Matt.</hi> 26.33. But obſerve, that though <hi>Peter</hi> was thus ſtout and courageous, yet becauſe he relyed upon his own ſtrength, he fell by a three-fold denial of his Maſter; So <hi>Matth.</hi> 26.69. God doth ever diſmount ſelf confidence, and throw it in the dirt: a proud, ſelf confident Chriſtan, is ſeldom ſucceſsful, or inſtrumental in the work of God. I have not read of any, as far as I remember. The truth is, a man is ever the leaſt able, and uſeful, when he thinks himſelf the beſt. The ſtronger thou thinkeſt thy ſelf the weaker thou art. The more thou truſteſt to a ſtrength within thy ſelf, the leſs thou ſhalt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive from God. How often have we found it by experience, that when we have expected great things by and from our own ſtrength, we have been moſt foiled: and the higher we have built our neſt in the rock of inherent ſtrength, the lower we have fallen. What is the reaſon, that when Chriſtians have thought themſelves the moſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for an ordinance, they have received the leaſt benefit by it. And when they have been the moſt enlarged in a duty, they have miſcarried
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:62437:26"/>ſuddenly after it. And when they have received the moſt comfort in a duty, or an ordinance, they have had the darkeſt cloud upon their ſpirits im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately following? Nay, when they have recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the greateſt influence from Divine ſtrength, for the increaſe of grace, yet they have found a ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible withdrawing of the Spirit of God afterwards from them. O Beloved, it is becauſe they have reſted upon theſe more then they have upon God the rock of their ſtrength: and therefore when your ſtrength is greateſt, do not rely up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, When your work is little, yet be ſelf-diffident: It is not for a Chriſtian to ſay, my work is but ſmall, and therefore I may rely upon my ſelf for ability to perform it. For though ſome works of a Chriſtian are but little in compariſon of others, yet no work is ſo little, but will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire a greater ſtrength, than what thou haſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived; full is that; 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.5. What work is leſs then that of thoughts? And yet ſaith the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle, <hi>we are not ſufficient of our ſelves to think any thing, as of our ſelves:</hi> if thy Spiritual and Natural ſtrength be never ſo great, and thy work never ſo little, yet thou muſt have a freſh ſupply of ſtrength from God thy Rock, or elſe thou canſt not perform it well. Beloved, we may as well give our ſelves a Licence or Commiſſion, as we may depend upon our own ſtrength, for the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of the leaſt duty. But if we have no Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion for our work, but our own, it can't own God for its Soveraign: and if we have no ſtrength but our own, to perform it by, it can't call God Father: neither will it be acceptable to
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:62437:27"/>him, or rewarded by him: as you may ſee; <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.6. <hi>Without faith it is impoſſible to pleaſe God:</hi> As without faith in Chriſt for acceptance, ſo without faith in God for aſſiſtance. Works per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed meerly by a ſelf ſtrength, are not of the right ſtamp, they come not from God, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore cannot have acceptance with God. They are not the off ſpring of Divine ſtrength; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore cannot intitle themſelves to Divine fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, When your ſpiritual enemies are ſtill and quiet: ſin within, and Satan without, are not always alike active againſt thee. No! they lie in wait for an advantage, that they may take thee of a ſudden, when thou art at a diſtance from the rock of thy ſtrength. <hi>What though the roar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Lion hath betaken himſelf to his Den, and there lurks, will any man be ſo fooliſh, as to quit his place of ſafety; and (truſting to his corporal ſtrength) walk to and fro by the mouth of the Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons Den?</hi> much leſs ſhouldeſt thou forſake God the rock of thy ſtrength, and walk up and down the world, where Satan lurks, and ſometimes hides himſelf from thee, with a dependance upon thy ſelf ſtrength for ſafety: for thou knoweſt not how ſoon he may break forth upon thee. No! but in the time of thy greateſt peace, labour for the neareſt and cloſeſt communion with thy God. Betake thy ſelf to that rock of ſtrength, that muſt be thy ſafety in time of trouble: excellent was that piece of policy of <hi>Aſa,</hi> 2 <hi>Chro.</hi> 14.6, 7. He that will not make God the rock of his ſtrength in the time of peace, can't expect God to be his rock of ſtrength in the time of war: He that
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:62437:27"/>will be ſheltered from a ſtorm at Sea, muſt not quit and forſake the ſhip in a calm. Gods counſel therefore to <hi>Noah</hi> was, to enter into his Ark be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the ſtorm came: and this muſt be your pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe if you would be ſafe; you muſt not truſt your own naked ſelf ſtrength, no, not in the moſt ſerene part of your life: for you know not how ſoon a ſtorm may ariſe, an enemy may aſſault you, and then what will you do?</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Reſt upon God alone for all ſtrength: throw thy ſelf into his arms, that he may bear thee up, and carry thee along through all thy ways. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 37.5, 6, 7, <hi>Commit thy way unto the Lord, truſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo in him, &amp;c.</hi> Or roll thy way upon the Lord; Throw thy ſelf firſt, and then thy way upon God; for he is thy ſtrength, and ſupporter; So <hi>Pſal.</hi> 55.22, <hi>Caſt thy burden upon the Lord, and he ſhall ſuſtein thee;</hi> The beſt way to eaſe thy ſelf, is to lay thy load upon God, he will take it up, and alſo carry thee. There is many a man would be willing to go of himſelf, if another would but carry his burden for him: but if thou throweſt thy burden upon God, he will not only carry that, but will alſo carry thee. He cares not how much weight a Chriſtian layeth on his back: a true <hi>Iſraelite</hi> may eaſe himſelf, and beſt pleaſe his God at once. God delights not to ſee tears in thine eyes, or paleneſs in thy countenance: thy groans and ſighs make no Muſick in his ears: he had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that thou wouldeſt free thy ſelf of thy bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, by caſting it upon him, that he might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce in thy joy and comfort. Now true confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in God, and reſting upon God, will both free thee of thy burden, and alſo bring in the
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:62437:28"/>ſtrength of God, to ſuſtein and bear thee up from falling: wouldeſt thou therefore own God as thy ſtrength, and fetch ſtrength from God to thy ſoul, reſt upon God, roll thy ſelf upon him. And that,

                  <p>Firſt, In times of greateſt weakneſs; when thou feeleſt thine inherent ſtrength to fail, yet be not diſcouraged, but reſt upon the rock of thy ſtrength. That is the trueſt act of Faith, that hath no created ſupporters: but is terminated in God alone: it is no hard matter for a ſtrong man to believe, and to be confident, but it is a difficult thing for a man to diſcern the truth of his faith, when created ſtrength is at its height; take away the crutch, and then you will ſee, what he will lay hold on next, to bear up his lame legs with. When a Chriſtian finds nothing in himſelf, then to reſt on God, is an evidence of true faith. Faith in God under poverty of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, is a precious faith: 'tis ſuch a faith as is pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar to the people of God; ſuch a faith as they muſt ſet on work; <hi>Zeph.</hi> 3.12, <hi>I will leave among you, men that are humble, a poor people, and they ſhall truſt in the name of the Lord.</hi> When God hath emptied a man of all ſelf-ſtrength, and made him poor, then is the time for him to truſt in the Lord. God hath a way to make a rich man poor, and take nothing from him, and to make a ſtrong man weak, and yet not diminiſh his ſtrength. <hi>Quest.</hi> How doth God this?
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:62437:28"/>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> By giving him an humble ſpirit; making him poor in ſpirit, So that his heart is taken off his riches, and off his ſtrength, and now ſuch an one will truſt in God. But ſometimes God makes men poor, and brings them low indeed, on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, that they may learn to truſt in God alone. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.10. <hi>We received the ſentence of death, that we might learn, not to truſt in our ſelves, but in the living God;</hi> So 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.5, <hi>She that is a widow, is left alone, and truſts in God.</hi> Why truly to allude to this; there is many a ſoul who hath been wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to a ſelf-ſtrength, and God hath cut it off, and made her a widow; one left alone, that ſhe might truſt in God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.4. O Beloved if this be your caſe, that God hath widdowed your ſouls, and ſtript you naked of all created and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated ſtrength, that you are poor and weak, helpleſs and comfortleſs, now is your time to caſt your ſouls on God for all ſtrength to bear you up.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, In times of the greateſt and higheſt ſervice and employment, whether doing or ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering, account God your ſtrength, by reſting on him, and truſting in him; 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.10, <hi>There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we labour and ſuffer reproach, becauſe we truſt in the living God.</hi> The work of the Apoſtles and Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Chriſtians was very great, and very high; they ſtood in need of a mighty aid, for it was beyond their inherent ſtrength, and therefore they did commit themſelves, and their work, to the rock of their ſtrength. As there is no work ſo little but exceeds our ſtrength, ſo there is no work ſo great, but there is a proportion'd ſtrength to it, to be had in God. When God
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:62437:29"/>therefore calls thee forth to hard and high ſervice, ſuch as makes every vein in thy heart to bleed, and every ſtring ready to crack, do not think it a work beyond omnipotency's power: ſit not down de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected, as if God required impoſſibilities of thee, but truſt him; and thou ſhalt but bear the name, he will do the work: no man ever failed in his work, who had the ſtrength of God for his help. His ſtrength ever riſes as his work riſes, and the higher the ſervice is, the greater ſhall be his ſtrength, <hi>Eſay</hi> 40.29, 30, 31. <hi>And therefore when God called Moſes forth to deliver Iſrael from the power of Egypt,</hi> ſee what he ſaith to him, <hi>Exod.</hi> 3.10, 11, obſerve here, <hi>Moſes is doubtful of his own ſtrength, and pleads that, as an excuſe for his refuſal of the work.</hi> Who am I? <hi>q. d.</hi> Alaſs, this is a work beyond my skill and ability to perform. Now, to this, God anſwers, by a promiſe of his preſence; <hi>I will certainly be with thee: q. d.</hi> I will make up all thy imperfections and weakneſs in mine own fulneſs and ſtrength: the greater the work is, the more I will manifeſt my ſelf; and the leſs thou haſt in thy ſelf, the more thou ſhalt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive from me. And therefore when <hi>Moſes</hi> pleads his excuſe with a particular demonſtration of his inability; God gives a particular anſwer. <hi>Exod.</hi> 4.10, 11, 12, Lord (ſaith <hi>Moſes</hi>) <hi>I am not cloquent, but am ſlow of ſpeech, and of a ſlow tongue, and therefore very unfit for the work.</hi> I am not able to deliver thy meſſage either to <hi>Pharao</hi> or to the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> but ſhall rather ſpoil it, then deliver it. Now God gives a particular anſwer to this particular objection. Firſt, by way of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrogation; Who made mans mouth? <hi>i.e.</hi> Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:62437:29"/>I that made the mouth, cure the imperfection of it? cannot I give thee an eloquent and a ready tongue. Secondly, by way of particular promiſe in reference to that particular caſe. Now there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore go, and I will be with thy mouth, and teach thee what thou ſhalt ſay; the like you have, <hi>Matt.</hi> 10.19, <hi>It ſhall be given you in that ſame hour, what ye ſhall ſpeak.</hi> Divine aſſiſtances do ever flow in according to the greatneſs of the work; It ſhall be all one to thee, to perform a very high piece of ſervice for God, with a ſtrength proportioned to it, as it will be to do a leſſer work with a little ſtrength. Do but reſt upon the rock of your ſtrength, and you will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be troubled at your work.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, In times of the greateſt trials: when thou art conflicting with ſpiritual or corporal enemies, then reſt on the rock of thy ſtrength. Sometimes a Chriſtian is (as it were) drawn forth into the field to encounter with ſin and Satan, and theſe two grand enemies of the ſouls Salvation, do ſet all their power and policy on work, to foil and ruine him: ſin, that ſets upon him (as Satans meſſenger) and buffets him, and Satan ſtands with his bow in his hand, and ſhoots fiery darts at him, to wound and torment his ſoul: Now what ſhould he do in this caſe? why, reſt on the rock of his ſtrength. It was a ſaying of <hi>Luther: He that moſt ſtrongly truſts to Gods aſſiſtance, he moſt ſurely defends himſelf.</hi> And I find it written of S. <hi>Auguſtin,</hi> that after his firſt converſion to the faith, he was grievouſly vexed with inward con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicts againſt his corrupt affections; and after long ſtrugling with them by a ſelf-ſtrength, which
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:62437:30"/>he found too weak to overcome, and muſing what to do more, he heard a voice ſaying, <hi>in te ſtas &amp; non ſtas: thou ſtandeſt in thy ſelf, and therefore doſt not ſtand.</hi> Whereupon apprehending that a ſelf-ſtrength could not mortifie and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer his corruptions, he betook himſelf to the rock of his ſtrength, and at laſt found ſuch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward aſſiſtance thereby, as made him ſtand his ground, and overcome his enemies. And this is according to Holy Writ; as you may ſee, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 6.10, 12. <hi>Finally my brethren be ſtrong in the Lord and in the power of his might; for we wreſtle not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt fleſh and blood, but againſt principalities, &amp;c. i.e.</hi> If you would be able to encounter with your ſpiritual adverſaries, and to ſtand your ground, you muſt reſt upon the rock of your ſtrength: you muſt be ſtrong in the Lord, and in the power of his might. <hi>Fides ſit tecum, &amp; tecum eſt Deus in tribulatione, Aug. in Pſal.</hi> 90, <hi>Have faith with thee, and God is with thee.</hi> And know this, that the ſtrength of ſin and Satan, could never match the ſtrength of God; and hence it is, that the people of God have ever conquered, both ſin and Satan at the laſt, and are able to ſay as <hi>Paul, thanks be to God that giveth us the victory,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.</note> 
                     <hi>and cauſeth us to triumph.</hi> And what though a Chriſtian is beſet with corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral enemies, yet if he do but ſet faith on work, he ſhall find ſtrength coming from the rock of his ſtrength to bear him up againſt them. And hence is that of <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 56.3, <hi>at what time I am a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid I will truſt in thee.</hi> The fleſh will have its work in a good man, and ſtir up paſſions of fear and grief, when danger is near; I, but theſe ſhall
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:62437:30"/>not get the upper hand, if faith be ſet on work, and therefore ſaith <hi>David, at what time I am a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid, I will truſt in thee.</hi> And as it overcomes our fears, ſo it overcomes our dangers too: for it carries the ſoul to the rock of ſtrength to help us againſt them. Moſt full is that of <hi>Aſa,</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 14.8, 9, 10, <hi>uſ<expan>
                           <am>

                        </expan> fin.</hi> The like you have, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 20.12, 13, 15, &amp; <hi>Judges</hi> 7.14. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 118.6, 7, to the 14, &amp; <hi>David</hi> to <hi>Goliah,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 17.45.</p>
                  <p>This is the firſt branch of the uſe.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Is God the rock of your ſtrength? then give God the glory of your ſtrength: Take heed of robbing God, that you may ſacrifice to your ſelves: but as you have the comfort, ſo let him have the glory.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. By due acknowledgements; ſay in your hearts and with your tongues, all my ſtrength is from God, and all my ſtrength is in God, and God is the rock of my ſtrength: Thus doth <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 18.32. <hi>It is God that girdeth me with ſtrength. Pſal.</hi> 27.1. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 28 7, 8. <hi>and he exhorts others there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, Pſal.</hi> 68.34.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. By a frequent reviewing and recording your experience of heart-ſtrengthening influences: call to mind and take ſpecial notice of the incomes of ſtrength from God, A Chriſtian ſhould be Gods Notary, and his heart a book of Records, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in all the memorable incomes of God, are written down. He that ſeeth not what God hath done for him, will never give God the praiſe of his doings: and he that buries Gods works in forgetfulneſs, makes God a looſer by his gains. Hence it is, that <hi>David</hi> rouſes up his ſoul, and all within him, and lays that charge upon himſelf, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 103.2.
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:62437:31"/>
                     <hi>Forget not all his benefits;</hi> He that will give God the glory of a mercy, muſt ſhew it written firſt upon his heart; the heart is the firſt mover in a man: all a mans members are but the Organs of the ſoul, that ſets them all on work; the tongue will ſing and praiſe God, when the heart dictates to it, and ſtirs it up: now unleſs a mans memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry be active, and his underſtanding quick in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viewing, and calling to mind the incomes of God, the heart will lie dead, and never ſtir.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. By imploying your ſtrength for God, that God may have his own returned with advantage: This is Gods end in giving you ſtrength, that you may work for him: Oh, take heed of a ſloathful idle ſpirit; for this is to bury your ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent in the earth of ſenſuality and vanity; and hence it is that <hi>Paul</hi> admoniſhes <hi>Timothy,</hi> to ſtir up the gift that was in him, and not to neglect it; 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.14. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.6. This is alſo his charge upon the <hi>Romans, Rom.</hi> 12.12, an unactive ſtrong Chriſtian is as unprofitable, as he that hath no ſtrength: and an unprofitable ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant is in great danger of five evils,

                  <p>Firſt, Of the loſs of Gods comforting preſence; He that doth not draw nigh to God in duty, ſhall not find God nigh to him in comfort. Can any
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:62437:31"/>idle ſervant expect the favour of his Maſter, and a reward at night, when as he hath loytred all the day? No more, may idle, unactive Chriſtians. How canſt thou expect a ſmile, from God, or any manifeſtation of love, that ſpendeſt thy moſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious time and ſtrength in the ſervice of another Maſter? as the withdrawing of Gods quickening preſence lays the ſoul up, that it grows dull and heavy: ſo a dull and dead Spirit unto Holy Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, oftentimes cauſeth God to withdraw his comforting preſence. You have both in one verſe, <hi>Eſay</hi> 64.7, <hi>And there is none that calleth upon thy name, that ſtirreth up himſelf to take hold on thee, for thou haſt hid thy face from us, and haſt conſumed us, becauſe of our iniquities.</hi> The reaſon why they were ſo dead and unactive, that they ſtirred not up themſelves, to take hold on God, was becauſe God had hid his face from them; and the reaſon of Gods hiding his face from them, was for their iniquities, ſins of omiſſion, as well as of commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. Little do Chriſtians think, what they looſe, when they neglect an opportunity of calling upon Gods name, ſeeking Gods face, hearing of his word, and putting their graces upon exerciſes: Why, they looſe the comforts of God, that are to be enjoyed in thoſe exerciſes; the leaſt ray and drop of which are more to be prized then the whole world. God never hides his face ſo ſoon, and ſo long from a Chriſtian, as when he with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draws his hand from Holy work. As Apoſtaſie from God and his ways cauſeth a total rejection, God turns his back upon that man, that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draws from him; ſo a deadneſs and dulneſs in the work of God, will moſt certainly cauſe a frown
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:62437:32"/>from God. He hides his face from ſuch, as being aſhamed to own them. And indeed it is a ſhame, that Satans ſervants ſhould be more active and laborious in his vaſallage and drudgery, then the ſervants of God oftentimes are in their high and heavenly calling and employment. I ſay, God is even aſhamed of them, and therefore hides his face from them. O it is very good for Chriſtians to examine themſelves, when they find an ebb in their comforts, whether there is not an ebb in their ſpirits, that they are not ſo lively and active for God as they have been.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, idle, unactive Chriſtians, that do not lay out their ſtrength for God, are in danger of the loſs of Gods aſſiſting preſence for a time. To what purpoſe ſhould God give in new influences, when as the ſoul neglects to lay out his former incomes? What reaſon hath the ſoul to expect, that God ſhould ſtand by him, and give in a new ſupply of grace, to ſit ſtill, and do nothing? God is not ſo prodigal of his grace, and 'tis but folly in the ſoul to expect it. The promiſe runs thus; the Lord is with you, while you are with him, <hi>i. e.</hi> when the ſoul waits upon God in the way of obedience, and is faithful to lay out communicated ſtrength therein to the utmoſt, then God attends all his motions, and communicates new ſupplies to help him forward therein: but now when the heart grows dead, and the ſpirit dull to Holy employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, God withdraws himſelf, and leaves the ſoul for a time. Some ſay, they muſt not enter upon a duty, until the ſpirit of God moves them: Why truly ſuch men oftentimes ſit ſtill a long time without a motion from the ſpirit. No: we muſt
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:62437:32"/>attempt our duty, and then we may hope for the motions of the ſpirit: but otherwiſe we cannot. The Holy Spirit is an active Spirit, and he cannot endure to lodge in an idle unactive ſoul: alſo when the ſoul once takes off his hand from Holy em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment, the Holy Spirit departs. The Church never found ſuch a ſenſible withdrawing of her beloved from her, as when ſhe was laid down to reſt her ſelf upon her pillow of eaſe and ſelf en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment. As you may ſee, <hi>Cant.</hi> 5.2, 6. <hi>She found it very hard to recal him, and recover her enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of him.</hi> And ſo it will be with all thoſe that are in that poſture. Mark her expreſſion: <hi>I opened to my beloved, but my beloved had withdrawn himſelf and was gone: my ſoul failed when he ſpake. I ſought him, but I could not find him, I called him, but he gave me no anſwer.</hi> See here how God repays the ſoul in its own Coyn. She will do nothing for God, and now God will do nothing for her. She would not anſwer God, when he called, but was dumb and ſilent, and now God will not anſwer her, when ſhe calls. She would not ſeek him, when he offered to be found of her, and now he will not be found, though ſhe ſeek him. She would not lay out that ſtrength for God which ſhe had, and now he denies her that ſtrength, which ſhe wants.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, An idle, unactive Chriſtian is in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of falling into ſome powerful temptation. When a man once leaves off working for God, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan will preſently ſet him to work. If thou canſt not find in thine heart to pray, meditate, believe, repent, and walk cloſe with God, the Devil will find thee work to thy coſt. The truth is, the ſoul
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:62437:33"/>of man can't lie ſtill, it muſt move and act: Now if it be taken off from that which is good, it will fall to that which is naught. Little did <hi>David</hi> think, what a bait Satan had laid for him, when he went up to the roof of his houſe, and there walked; from thence did thoſe two horrible ſins of uncleanneſs and murther take their riſe. When a man goeth forth out of his Chamber in a morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, with a purpoſe to ſpend a day idly and vain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, he little thinks what the iſſue thereof may be before night. An idle unactive Chriſtian tempts Satan to tempt him, and Satan never goeth up and down unprovided, but according to the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of the perſon, or the ſeaſon of the year, or the place of a mans converſe, or the age of his life, fits and prepares ſuch a ſnare for him, as may moſt undoubtedly catch him, to the breaking of his peace, and the wounding of his conſcience; And indeed the leſs any Chriſtian works for God, the greater advantage Satan hath to work upon him. When thou intermitteſt thy ſeaſons of praying and converſing with God in his Holy Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances, then the roaring Lion comes, and makes a prey of thee: Thou art then meat for his tooth: And know this, that ſins of Commiſſion do, for the moſt part, if not always, take their riſe at ſins of Omiſſion. Thou doſt not perform that which God commands, and Satan provokes thee to that which God hath forbidden. Thou ſtragleſt and wandereſt out of Gods way, and 'tis no wonder if this high way adverſary take thee up.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Thou art in danger of having thy heart more corrupted hereby. The heart of the
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:62437:33"/>beſt is bad enough, but by idleneſs it will be worſe. Standing water will ſoon corrupt; and ſo will an idle unactive ſpirit. The leſs a Chriſtian is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in Holy Duties, the worſe will his heart grow, more prone to evil, and leſs diſpoſed to good. When a Clock ſtands ſtill long, the wheels will contract ruſt, and put it out of Order. Even thus it will be with the heart of man; when it is not in continual motion towards God, and often wound up into an heavenly frame, it contracts a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance of filth, that puts it out of order, and renders it unfit for holy action: it his hard to get the heart into a good frame for communion with God, if a Chriſtian take never ſo much pains with it; but if it be in never ſo good a temper, it will ſoon be out again, if a man take not as much pains to keep it ſo, as to get it into it. The cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption that is in mans heart, will quickly over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>top his grace, if he ſtirs not up himſelf to oppoſe it. An idle Chriſtian cannot continue a good Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian long.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, If thou beeſt idle and unactive thy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual ſtrength will much abate: So much as thou abateſt of this Chriſtian work, ſo much will thy ſpiritual ſtrength abate. He that will not work when he can, will not be able to work when he would. For as grace is ſtrengthened by exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe, ſo it decays by idleneſs; And it is a juſt judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God to take away our Talents from us when we do not improve them for his advantage, <hi>Matt.</hi> 25.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Branch</hi> 2. God is <hi>Iſraels</hi> portion for ever.</p>
                  <p>Now in the handling this truth I ſhall do three things.</p>
                  <pb n="40" facs="tcp:62437:34"/>
                  <list>
                     <item>1. Prove it by Scripture.</item>
                     <item>2. Explain it.</item>
                     <item>3. Give you the grounds and reaſons, and ſo ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply it.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p>Firſt, For proof, turn to that of <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 119.57. &amp; 142.5. <hi>Jer.</hi> 10.16, the ſame with <hi>Jer.</hi> 51.19, word for word, and <hi>Lam.</hi> 3.24.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, For explanation, I ſhall both give you the ſenſe of the word; and alſo ſhew you in what reſpect God is a portion.</p>
                  <p>In the Hebrew word, there is a Metaphor ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from the old cuſtom of dividing inheritances, in which every heir had his part given him by lot: and that was called his portion; ſo <hi>Joſh.</hi> 18.5.6. In like manner God is <hi>Iſraels</hi> portion. <hi>A diviſion is made of heaven and earth; of God and the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: the men of the world have their portion in the world. Pſal.</hi> 17.14, <hi>and the Iſrael of God, have God for their portion.</hi> Now a portion notes out a mans All; All he hath to live upon for ſuſtenance content and ſatisfaction. But God is the godly man's All. <hi>Deus eſt unde vivant. Aug in Pſa.</hi> 119.57. <hi>He lives upon God. God is his ſuſtentation content and ſatisfaction.</hi> Though God ſometimes is pleaſed to give much of the earth to a godly man; as he did to <hi>Abraham, Lot, &amp;c.</hi> yet that is not their portion, not their All. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſaith the Pſalmiſt, <hi>Whom have I in heaven but thee,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73.25.</note> 
                     <hi>viz. as my por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?</hi> And ſo when God takes away all a Chriſtians earthly ſubſtance, he takes not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way his portion. <hi>Job</hi> loſt all his earthly goods, and yet <hi>Job</hi> loſt not his portion. God was his All ſtill. When God gives riches in abundance
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:62437:34"/>to a godly man, 'tis but God in thoſe riches, God in lands,<note place="margin">Dat deus portionem in terra viventium, ſed non aliquid a ſe extra ſe. Aug. in Pſal. <hi>14.2.5.</hi>
                     </note> God in money, God in All: and therefore theſe may be all taken from him, and yet he keep his portion ſtill. In like manner if a godly man have never ſo much of the world, he is not ſatisfied therewith unleſs God be his too. When <hi>Luther</hi> had many gifts ſent him by good friends, he turn'd himſelf to God, and ſaid, <hi>That God ſhould not put him off with theſe things: As an heir though he have money, cloathes and victuals, yet ſtill looks after the inheritance:</hi> 'tis ſo with a good man.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, In what reſpect may God be ſaid to be a portion?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> A portion hath three properties in it; and all attributable unto God.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, a portion is a good, <hi>Matt.</hi> 7.11, and hence a mans eſtate is called <hi>bona;</hi> becauſe it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts of ſeveral good things. Thus God is a por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for he is good, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 100.5. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 34.8, <hi>O taſte and ſee that the Lord is good.</hi> Nay, God is the chief and higheſt good: not only good, but goodneſs it ſelf; All good in created beings is a participation of Divine Goodneſs. For there is but one efficient, exemplary and final goodneſs: that from whence good comes, according to which all good things are made, and to which all things tend. The goodneſs of God is not only the Original copy and firſt Idea according to which God drew all things, but the higheſt good, whereunto all things do tend, as their ultimate end. So <hi>Rom.</hi> 11 <hi>ult. For of him, and through him, and for him are all things.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="42" facs="tcp:62437:35"/>
                  <p>Secondly, A portion is a ſuitable good. Men do not give Stones and Scorpions, Poiſon or Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to their Children as a portion, <hi>Matt.</hi> 7.11. Thus God is a portion; For he is a ſutable good; Nothing ſo ſutable to the ſtate of man, and the nature of the ſoul, as God is. Name what you will, riches, honours, pleaſures in the world are not; theſe are heterogeneal things; The ſoul of man is ſpiritual and ſubline: Such a good is God; and whatever the ſoul pants after it is enjoyable in him. Hence God is reſembled, and ſet out by ſuch things as man ſtands moſt in need of, and are the moſt delightful to the heart of man.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. God ſets forth himſelf by the element of water, ſo <hi>Eſay</hi> 33.21, <hi>Now water is a refreſhing creature, to the ſpirit of a thirſty man,</hi> Eſay 32.2.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. God is alſo life, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 36.9. now what is more ſuitable or convenient unto a dead man then life? a dead man can't have true content and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction; nothing can ſuſtein and keep a dead corpſe from putrifaction and corruption, but life. All beings ſink and periſh without life. They are comfortleſs and miſerable without life. I, but that ſoul that enjoys God, hath life, his preſence quickens a dead ſoul to the life of God, the life of holineſs, and the life of happineſs. So that he that enjoys God, is eternally ſuſtein'd and can never die. So <hi>John</hi> 6.50, to 57.3, God is alſo ſet forth under the notion of light. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 27.1, a thing moſt comfortable and pleaſant; and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding ſuitable to the ſtate of man. Darkneſs ſhuts up a man in miſery: but light brings him forth. Man is brought into the world in a ſtate
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:62437:35"/>of darkneſs, and never ſeeth the light of life, until he comes to God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 36.9, In thy light ſhall we ſee light. In a word, God is that which the ſoul ſtands in need of to render it happy and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious. Whatever the ſoul wants, it muſt have from God. It is he alone that gives grace and glory; and when he hath given both; himſelf muſt be all in all or elſe the ſoul can't have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent: given what you will to a thirſty heart, and yet it is not content unleſs you give him that which is convenient for thirſt. 'Tis not gold, nor ſilver, that will ſatisfie him: No, he muſt have drink: 'tis ſo in all other caſes. In like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, a ſoul that hungers and thirſts after God, cannot be ſatisfied without the enjoyment of him.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, A portion is an adaequate and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable good. Every legacy is not a portion. A portion (as was hinted before) is a mans lively<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, his All. Now a mans All muſt be propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned to a mans neceſſity; it muſt be enough to live upon. Thus God is the Saints portion; he is enough; the ſoul needs no more then God to live upon; God may well be the Saints All; for he is All-ſufficient, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.1, <hi>I am the Almighty God,</hi> or <hi>God All-ſufficient;</hi> God is <hi>pars abundantiſſima, &amp; ſufficientiſſima.</hi> The ſoul that enjoys God may truly ſay as <hi>Eſau</hi> to his brother <hi>Jacob,</hi> when he offered him a large preſent, <hi>Gen.</hi> 33.9, I have enough Brother, or as the prodigal ſaid of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>there is bread enough and to ſpare,</hi> Luk. 15.17; there is not only enough, but much to ſpare in God. The ſoul is of a vaſt capacity, all the world can't give it enough, I, but God can, and
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:62437:36"/>yet when it is ſatisfied, he hath never the leſs ſtill. The heart of man is ever craving and beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging until it be filled with all the fulnes of God; and then it is quiet. That man that takes up his reſt, and ſaith within himſelf, I have enough, I need not ask any more, I may leave off praying and ſeeking, is either very ignorant of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſions and fulneſs of God, or elſe is very proud and ſelf-conceited. For let a man draw never ſo much, yet the well is deep, and there is as much as ever was. O the bottomleſs goodneſs of God! O the inexhauſtible fountain of Divine per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection! No heart is able to fathom or contain it. Demonſtration.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Q</hi> But how comes God to be the Saints portion?</p>
                  <p>Firſt, it flows from Gods free donation, God hath given himſelf to his Saints. That is properly a mans portion, that his father gives him. Now becauſe God can give no greater good then him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, therefore he gives himſelf to his Saints. God is their Father, and they muſt have a portion from him: and God cannot think any thing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low himſelf a portion for them. He can give the world to his enemies, I, but he gives himſelf to his children; Hence it is ſaid, that God hath ſet apart him that is godly for himſelf, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 4.3, <hi>and the Lord hath choſen Jacob for himſelf, Pſal.</hi> 135.4, <hi>even as a man takes a child and adopts him, makes him his own, and then gives him a portion;</hi> ſo doth God. 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.1, and <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.17. Now what is the inheritance but God himſelf? Nothing below God is the inheritance of Chriſt who is the Son, and nothing leſs then God is the inheritance of Saints, who are Gods younger children; but
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:62437:36"/>this is not by humane purchaſe, but by Divine gift. For alaſs, all the gold &amp; ſilver in the world, is not to be weighed againſt God as a ſufficient price. All the nations of the earth, are but as a drop in the bucket, and, as the duſt in the ballance: Nay, as nothing, and counted to him leſs then nothing. No, this is an inheritance not to be bought by any finite price: Nay, whatever thou valueſt the moſt, yet comes infinitely ſhort of a ſufficient price. Wert thou more righteous then the Angels or <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> in innocency, yet all thy good works would not bring thee in a ray of Divine glory by way of merit. Why elſe had not the Apoſtate Angels and <hi>Adam</hi> in innocency the preſence of God, for their ſuſtentation to keep them from falling, but to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence this truth, that mans righteouſneſs cannot purchaſe the enjoyment of God?</p>
                  <p n="2">2. This flows from a Saints ſelf-denying reſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. A true Saint denyes himſelf in all but God, and to him he reſigns up himſelf. Self-denial outs a man of all earthly goods in point of affection and affiance; and carries him to God alone for ſuſtenance, content and comfort; So <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73.25. A true Chriſtian dare not own any thing as his All but God; He hath a true right to all that he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joys as to uſe, but he doth not account it as his portion; No, he reſigns himſelf to God, as his life and All; So <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 27.1, God is my life, <hi>i. e.</hi> I live upon God, and have all in him; I betake my ſelf wholly to him; and, to him only. So <hi>Pſal.</hi> 62.1. the word rendred (truly) ſignifies (only, <hi>i. e.</hi> I betake my ſelf to God alone; I go no whither elſe; and the truth is, none but a true Chriſtian knows the emptineſs of the creature,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:62437:37"/>and the fulneſs of God, and therefore he alone lets all go for God. Thoſe things which are the word<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings gain, a Saint accounts loſs for God; now when a man hath thus outed himſelf of All for God, he would have nothing at all to live upon, if he did not fix on God; as S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.19, <hi>If our hopes were in this life we were of all men the moſt miſerable.</hi> What, to looſe earth and heaven together? To deny a mans ſelf in all worldly advantages, and not to have a God to lay hold on? This is moſt ſad! No, therefore the Chriſtian is ſo wiſe as to make an happy exchange, to forſake all for God, and having forſaken all for God, God takes him to himſelf; Hence is that gratious promiſe, (<hi>Hoſ.</hi> 14.3.) <hi>The father<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs ſhall find mercy;</hi> God is the portion of none but ſpiritual Orphans; he becomes guardian to none other; Mercy in God ſuppoſes miſery in the creature. Now when the ſoul becomes the moſt wretched and miſerable in its own ſenſe, then it is an object of mercy, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.3, <hi>Bleſſed are the poor in ſpirit for their is the kingdom of God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. God is a Saints portion by way of fruition: he enjoys God truly here and fully hereafter. God is not only round about his people, as their wall of protection: but he is in their hearts as their life and well-head of eternal comfort and ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.24, <hi>He that keepeth his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments dwelleth in him, and he in him.</hi> There is a mutual inhabitation; they dwell each in other, and ſo enjoy one another. So vaſt is the ſoul of man, that nothing but God can fill it, and therefore God dwells in a Saint: ſo immenſe
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:62437:37"/>and incomprehenſible are the dimenſions of God, that nothing is able to hold them, and therefore a Saint muſt enter into and dwell in God. Hence is that prayer of the Apoſtle for the <hi>Epheſians, Chap.</hi> 3.19. <hi>that they might be filled with all the fulneſs of Chriſt;</hi> So that of our Saviour, <hi>Matt.</hi> 25.21. The more an earthly portion dwells and lodgeth in the heart, the more it ſinks and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyes the man: but this is our life and ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, our glory and our heaven, to be full of God. Gods indwelling in the ſoul is its reſurrection, and exaltation, <hi>Eſay</hi> 57.15, 16. Now for the right underſtanding hereof, you muſt know, that this indwelling of God in the ſoul, is not eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentially, as the God-head dwelt in the humane nature of Chriſt, and made up one perſon: but myſtical and ſpiritual,
<list>
                        <item>1. By lively impreſſion.</item>

                  </p>
                  <p>Firſt, God dwells in the heart by lively impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion: God ſtamps his own image upon the heart, and ſo lives in it, as the father lives in his child: a ſoul conform'd to God, is a ſoul full of God. Then is the ſoul taken up into the life and light of God, when it is made like to God, holy as he is holy. Then God lives in the heart, when a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of holineſs is planted in the heart; and when the lines of his glory are drawn upon it; ſo ſaith the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>John</hi> 4.12, 16. God is love. The love of God is his image; he that loveth truly and ſincerely, he dwelleth in God, and God in him; There are ſome that dream of an immediate viſion of God, they ſee him in his Eſſence; but ſaith <hi>John, No man hath ſeen God at any time: if we
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:62437:38"/>love one another, God dwelleth in us, and we in him, i. e.</hi> If the image of Divine glory be enſtampt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon our hearts, and appears in its lively acts of grace and goodneſs, love and ſweetneſs, then have we true and cloſe communion and fellowſhip with the Father. So 1 <hi>John</hi> 1.7. <hi>If we walk in the light, as he is in the light, then have we fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip one with another.</hi> This is to ſee God, know him and enjoy him, for the ſoul to be made like to him; transformation of the ſoul into Divine ſimilitude gives it the fulleſt enjoyment of God, that it is capable of. As the ſoul is in likeneſs un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God, ſo it enjoys him. Perfection of holineſs gives the ſoul a perfect fruition of God. Saints in glory are perfectly holy, and therefore do enjoy God perfectly.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, God dwells in the heart by gratious influx; he is continually giving forth Divine vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue to a Saint; as he is a fountain of grace and goodneſs, ſo he diffuſeth ſtreams thereof into the hearts of his people; he is ever doing them good; and according to their needs, ſo doth he ſupply them; mercy flows in according to the ſtate and condition of the ſoul; ſometimes healing, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times quickning, ſtrengthning, comforting, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting, and teaching; Hence is that of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet; <hi>Pſal.</hi> 36.8 9.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. It appears that God is a Saints portion by his improvement of his intereſt in God: men uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally do improve, and make the beſt of their eſtates they can, that they may live the moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortably upon it that may be. Saints are good huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands, and they do not let their portion lie dead by them; but do make the beſt of it they can.</p>

                  </list>
                  <p>Firſt, By Contemplation, a Saint takes great delight to behold God, not eſſentially as he is in his own beauty and purity; for ſo none can ſee God, and live; but manifeſtatively, as he is plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to reveal himſelf in his Son Jeſus: ſo <hi>John</hi> 1.18. When the Lord Jeſus doth declare his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to the ſoul, it is a raviſhing ſight; Even as a worldly man takes great delight to look upon his eſtate, to ſee his bags of money, his Barns of Grain, his cattle in his paſture; he feeds his mind upon them: ſo doth the ſoul of a gratious man feed it ſelf upon God by contemplation, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 104.34. <hi>my meditation of him ſhall be ſweet.</hi> It was like ſweet meats to the Prophets taſt. So <hi>Pſal.</hi> 139.17, 18, <hi>how precious are thy thoughts un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me, O God, &amp;c.</hi> I am ſtill with thee, <hi>i. e.</hi> I think on thee in the night, and wake with thee in the morning; and wherever I go, and wherever I am, ſtill my mind is on thee, and every thought is admirable and exceeding precious to me; a true Chriſtian had rather ſpend an hour with God in Contemplation, and Divine Meditation, then Eternity with the world; this feeds his ſoul, and delights his heart, and takes up his ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit; Well might the Apoſtle ſay, to be ſpiritually minded is life and peace; No ſuch life, no ſuch peace as flows in this way.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, By Supplication; the more he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joys of God the larger are his deſires after God. He muſt be ever ſucking and drawing at Divine breaſts, he goeth to God for all he wants, and
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:62437:39"/>the more he receives the more he craves; grace widens the heart and draws out the ſpirit; ſo that a Chriſtian never thinks he hath enough. He drinks, and drinks, and yet he is the more thirſty: he prays continually and without ceaſing; for one prayer begets another. As a man that hath an eſtate firſt calls for one thing, and then for an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other: and the uſe of one makes him deſire ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and more of all. So he that hath an intereſt in God firſt ſeeks one grace, and then another: and the uſe of one grace puts him upon the beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging of another. He wants knowledge, and he begs that, but knowledge without humility puffs up, and this makes him beg the grace of humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity; he begs ſtrength, I, but without faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and skill to lay it forth it profits not; and therefore he muſt have that: he prays for wiſdom and fidelity to uſe his ſtrength. As graces are lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked and combined together for uſe and helpful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs each to other; ſo are the ſouls deſires, like to haſty meſſengers, ready to tread upon one anothers heels. A Chriſtian ſomtimes is big with twins of holy deſires, and one comes firſt to the birth, and yet another (like to <hi>Pharez</hi>) ſteps forth, and makes a breach upon it. It is excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent to ſee, how the ſoul gets ground ſtill, and goeth on ſtill further and further by 'its deſires. As thriving men, firſt buy one piece of land and then another, until they have inlarged their ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritories to a mighty compaſs: ſo do Chriſtians inlarge their graces and comforts. It is with a Chriſtian, as it is recorded of the rain that fell in <hi>Ahabs</hi> time at the prayer of <hi>Elijah,</hi> 1 <hi>King.</hi> 18.44. ſo a Chriſtians deſires and returns are little
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:62437:39"/>at the firſt: but they greaten and greaten until they overſpread the whole heavens of the ſoul. <hi>Matth.</hi> 7.7, <hi>ask, and ye ſhall receive, ſeek and ye ſhall find, knock and it ſhall be opened unto you;</hi> Here is a gradation; the ſoul proceeds by ſteps, and accordingly receives; and as the ſoul ariſes higher and higher in its deſires and affections, ſo grace ariſeth higher and higher in its anſwers. A prayerful ſoul comes at laſt to be a graceful ſoul; Thou that art much with God in prayer, ſhalt have much of God in thine heart. As the Sun draws forth vapours from the earth, not for it ſelf, but to fatten the earth: ſo God draws forth the deſires of the ſoul, not to better, or to add any thing to his own being or happineſs, but to better the ſoul, and to add to its happineſs and to make it compleat.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, By Application the ſoul emproves God. A true Chriſtian makes an advantage of all Divine incomes and enjoyments; ſo that he encreaſes dayly with the increaſe of God. As a worldly man turns the peny, and makes it dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and at laſt an hundred-fold; ſo doth a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian: he hath an heavenly art, whereby he trades with, and grows rich in all goodneſs; His four talents brings him eight, &amp; his five gains him ten; A Chriſtians grace lies not dead by him, and of no uſe, but is dayly put forth into act and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſeth: The more he enjoys of God, the more he acteth for God, and the better he thrives: Prayer fetcheth in, and love lays out, until the man grows wonderfully rich; and gains a wonderful ſtock within him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</p>
                  <pb n="52" facs="tcp:62437:40"/>
                  <p>Uſe, 1. <hi>By way of inference; and hence we may infer.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Firſt, That the people of God are the richeſt people; they have the beſt portion the beſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance. So the Prophet accounts it, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 16.5, 6. <hi>The Lord is my portion, the lines are fallen unto me in a pleaſant place; Yea, I have a goodly heritage.</hi> A goodly heritage; the beſt that can be had; the fulleſt, the richeſt, and the moſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful. Saints have <hi>Benjamins</hi> portion, a meſs five times ſo much as the worldling's is; All is a Saints; for they have God who is all; What though they are ſometimes very poor in a worldly reſpect, yet they are wonderfully rich in an hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly reſpect. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.18. <hi>Jam</hi> 2.5. A Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian is a meer paradox and heavenly riddle; he hath nothing, and he hath All; he is poor and rich. <hi>Levi</hi> had no portion an ongſt the tribes, and yet had the beſt eſtate, for God was his portion. Alaſs, a worldlings portion is but a dark ſhadowy repreſentation of a Saints portion; his houſe and land, his food and rayment, his money and Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els, are but figures and reſemblances of a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians eſtate; There was far more difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>Solomons</hi> ſtables and out houſes for his hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and beaſt to ſtand in, and <hi>Solomons</hi> Ivory Throne, or Temple whereon <hi>Solomon</hi> laid out all his glory, than there is between the richeſt worldlings portion and a Saints. We are exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing apt to ſay of ſuch a man, He is wonderfully rich, he hath a vaſt eſtate, he is worth ſo many thouſands by the year; or he is a Prince in ſuch a Dominion, and a mighty man: but alaſs he is not to be compared with one of Gods poor Saints;
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:62437:40"/>A Chriſtian that hath not a peny in his purſe, nor a rag to cover his nakedneſs, nor a bit of bread to put in his mouth, is infinitely richer, then all the Princes and Potentates of the earth; For God is the portion of his Saints, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 37.16.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, That the people of God are a truly happy people. So ſaith the Prophet,<note place="margin">Aug. to <hi>9.</hi> p. <hi>48.</hi>
                     </note> 
                     <hi>Pſal.</hi> 144.15. Men account them happy that have <hi>aurum in arca;</hi> but they are truly happy, that have <hi>Deum in conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entia.</hi> For what is true happineſs? Why, it is the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of good commenſurate to all our deſires. Now this is the happineſs of Saints; they have a good commenſurare to; yea, and infinitely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond all their deſires. God is better to them, then they wiſh for or deſire; He exceeds the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt bounds of the largeſt heart. God often gives his Saints more then they ask, and yet the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of God, is beyond all his gifts. Saints know not to the full, what they ask, when they beg to be filled with all the fulneſs of God, and when God is enjoyed by them, they ſcarce know what they have. Theſe now muſt needs be happy, even to admiration. We may well ſay, O the happineſſes of that man, whoſe portion is the Lord.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, That the people of God cannot be made miſerable; as they are happy, ſo they are eternally happy, for they have a durable and eternal portion; worldly men are at a great uncertainty, they may be externally happy to day, and very
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:62437:41"/>miſerable to morrow; Nay in a moment a curſe comes upon them like an Eaſtern wind, and blaſts them irrecoverably; but of the righteous we may ſay as <hi>Iſaac</hi> concerning <hi>Jacob,</hi> he is bleſſed, and he ſhall be bleſſed; bleſſed to day, and bleſſed to morrow and for ever. A Saints eſtate is out of danger and hazzard: 'tis a treaſure that can't be plundered by thieves, nor devoured by moths, nor corrupted by ruſt, nor taken away by unjuſt dealings: 'tis a ſure and undeſciſable eſtate: nay 'tis an eſtate that can't be ſpent. A Chriſtian may live at as high a rate as poſſible he can; through faith and prayer, and yet he can't live at the height of it; he can't leſſen or diminiſh it: the meal in the bowl, and the oyl in the cruſe will never be ſpent. Worldly men never ſink in their eſtates until they come to ſpend of the ſtock; if they can but keep the Wolf from the door, they care not: 'tis ſo with a godly man; his ſtock and his portion holds, whatever he ſpends he ſpends not that.</p>
                  <p>Uſe, 2. <hi>For inſtruction; Is God the portion of</hi> Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el, <hi>then this may teach us,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. Where to have a portion for our ſelves and ours; Why, by making ſure of God; Alaſs, many perſons are plotting about an eſtate and a portion for themſelves, and their children, but God is not all their thoughts: and oftentimes it falleth out as the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> ſpeaks. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 146.4, that whilſt he is contriving and laying out his heart in this deſign, his breath goeth forth, he returneth to the earth, and in that very day his thoughts periſh; he dies a beggar, miſerably poor in eſtate, both for body and ſoul, and leaves his children nothing but
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:62437:41"/>an inheritance of their fathers ſin, and it may be the curſe of God for it; that whilſt he is roaring in hell, they are poſting thither as faſt as they can to increaſe his torments and make them more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolerable: But however, if it falls not out thus, that thou art defeated in thy deſign; but thou ſcrapeſt up an earthly portion for thy ſelf, and leaveſt that to thy children, what is this to the enjoyment of God? Oh, what can compenſate the loſs of God? Not the whole world if thou hadſt it; For alaſs, this earthly portion, is not the ſouls portion; I may help and relieve the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, but can do no good to the ſoul; that is poor, wretched, and miſerable, without the enjoyment of God; the ſoul hath nothing to live upon, whilſt it is without God; Now, what, muſt thy body be preferr'd above thy ſoul? Thy body, that is cloathed, fed, delighted, and kept ſafe; I, but thine immortal ſoul is laid naked, ſtarved, and miſerable. 'Tis poſſible for thee, through the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſions of Satan and the corruption of the fleſh, that thou mayſt ſhuffle on a while; I, but when thy naked ſoul ſhall fit trembling upon thy lips, and ask thee this one queſtion? Now whither muſt I go? What portion is for me? What canſt thou anſwer? Thou dar'ſt not ſay as <hi>Dives</hi> ſaid, <hi>ſoul take thine eaſe, thou haſt goods laid up for many years:</hi> For alaſs, thy ſoul then takes its leave of all earthly goods, when it takes its flight from thy body, and if it hath not God for its portion to go to, it hath nothing to live upon, no harbour nor ſhelter to keep it from that eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal ſtorm of Divine wrath which is ſhowred down from God upon it. I have heard it as one
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:62437:42"/>of the ſaddeſt complaints of ſome women, when their husbands were ready to die, that they had not an houſe to put their heads in, nor a friend to go to, and it may be little or nothing to help and relieve themſelves; and it may be the next news is, that they are thrown into priſon for their husbands debts. Why truly it is the godleſs ſouls caſe: that when the body dies, the ſoul hath no habitation provided for it; but muſt ſpeedily go to the common Goal, to be there kept as a miſerable priſoner, bound with the chains of eternal darkneſs, and to feed upon ſoul devouring flame of Divine vengeance to all Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</p>
                  <p>O friends, will not you be ſo wiſe therefore as to look out in time for a ſure portion for your ſouls; even for a God. Oh, live no longer godleſs, for ſo long as thou liveſt without God, thou haſt no proviſion made for thy ſoul.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. This may teach us, that if we would have God to be our portion, we muſt be Gods <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and Gods portion: as thou wouldeſt have God to be thine, ſo thou muſt be the Lords. Full is that of the ſpouſe, <hi>Cant.</hi> 2.16. <hi>my beloved is mine, and I am his;</hi> The intereſt between God and his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, comes to be mutual. So <hi>Pſal.</hi> 33.12. Thou canſt never truly ſay, that the Lord is thy God, until thou canſt ſay, thou art the inheritance of the Lord; Thou art never ſure of God as thy portion, until God hath made ſure of thee for his inheritance: He muſt have ſome intereſt in thy heart, or thou haſt no fruition of him.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Therefore, Set thy heart upon God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:62437:42"/>do not ſuffer it to be divided between many portions; let not the earthly portion ſhare one part, and ſin another, and the Devil another, and then what is left thou wilt be content that God ſhould have it; But know, that God will be all or none; the love of the world and the love of God is inconſiſtent; 1 <hi>John</hi> 2.15. You know when the Merchant had found the pearl, he ſells all for it; and ſo muſt thou; thy heart muſt be taken off all for God, and given up to him only. God never matches with an adultereſs, with one that doth not love him intirely: For then he would be but as a cloak for wickedneſs to hide it ſelf under, that it may be acted with greater ſecurity; As men that marry whores, they are but their wife's cloaks, they commit whoredom with the greater boldneſs; ſo would the heart of man, if it could enjoy God with the love of the world; it would ſin the more ſecurely and freely. God ſhould be but a cloak to its wickedneſs. No, thou muſt not think, that God will be thy portion, that thou mayſt play the harlot the more ſecurely; Oh, therefore ſet thine heart upon God alone; let him have the whole of thine heart; ſet thy heart wide open for God to come in, and take poſſeſſion of thy heart. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 24.7. <hi>This is the voice of Chriſt; open to me my ſiſter, my ſpouſe; Cant.</hi> 5.2, and, <hi>Behold, I ſtand at the door and knock, if any man open, I will come in.</hi> Now love to God is the opening of the heart to God, and lets him in, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertains him, and bids him welcome. Thus God dwells in the heart, and receives content and ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction from it.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, If thou wouldſt be Gods portion,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:62437:43"/>and Gods inheritance; thou muſt receive Gods mark upon thee, that thou mayſt be diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from all others; even as they that become the portion of Antichriſt muſt receive his mark in their foreheads, and in their hands. <hi>Revel.</hi> 13.16. So all they that do become Gods portion, muſt receive Gods mark upon them; they muſt be ſealed with Gods own ſeal, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.13. and <hi>Revel.</hi> 14.1. Even as Merchants ſet their mark or ſeal upon their goods, ſo doth God ſet his ſeal and mark upon all his goods, that they may be clearly known to him by their mark, as well as in his own decree. Now the diſtinguiſhing Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of a true <hi>Iſraelite</hi> from all others is Goſpel ſincerity, truth in the inward parts, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.47, a true <hi>Iſraelite</hi> in whom is no guile, <hi>Revel.</hi> 14.15, in their mouth was found no guile, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 32.2. Others may have gifts, and grace in ſhew, but Gods portion muſt have grace in truth; Others may have a form, but theſe have the power of godlineſs; Others may have lamps, but theſe have oyl in their lamps; Others may have a name, but theſe have the name of God written in their foreheads. Alaſs, God cares not for theſe hang-bies, who call themſelves by Gods name, and cry up themſelves as the only people of God, and yet never received the name of God upon their foreheads: but through a carnal liberty, which they aſſume to themſelves are on and off, in and out, when they pleaſe. Sometimes they are for God, and ſometimes for the Devil. No, Beloved, if you will be the Lords, you muſt be in good earneſt; fully engaged, mark'd out with this mark of holy ſincerity, ſo that God may have
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:62437:43"/>ſomething in you, whereby to own you. When God ſhall look abroad, and ſeek for his own, and find them ſcattered up and down, and mixed with the world, God will take notice of none, but ſuch as have his mark upon them, none but ſuch as are ſincere and upright; 'tis not a form of Anabaptiſm, or Quaking, or Seeking, but ſincerity, that God will own, <hi>Matth.</hi> 7.21, 22, 23.</p>
                  <p>Uſe, 3. <hi>For Direction and Counſel to all the</hi> Iſrael <hi>of God, who have God for their por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I have four words of advice for you.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Learn the diſtinction to the height; God in himſelf, or God in the creature, and the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture without God. There is a vaſt difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the enjoyment of God in himſelf, or in the creature, and the enjoyment of the creature, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the enjoyment of God. Some enjoy God, and not the creature, Some enjoy the creature, and not God, Some enjoy both. This is talked of amongſt us, and oftentimes little underſtood by us; but the right and clear underſtanding hereof, is of great concernment unto Chriſtians.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Some enjoy God and not the creature; theſe are (as I hinted before) poor and rich.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Some enjoy the creature and not God, theſe are rich, and yet poor; as having all, and yet ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving nothing.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Some enjoy God, and the creature; or God in the creature; Theſe are rich in all reſpects; they are worldly rich, and heavenly rich, they have a double portion. But now here lieth a great task and difficulty: it is hard for ſuch a
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:62437:44"/>Chriſtian ſo to diſtinguiſh between theſe two eſtates and portions, as not to confound them. As a man that drives two trades; 'tis very difficult for him to keep them diſtinct: So 'tis here, when men have much of the world, &amp; they drive a great trade therein, 'tis very difficult for them to diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh between God, and that, <hi>i. e.</hi> ſo to uſe the world, as not to make it his All; hence is that coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel of the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.29, 30, 31, and ſo 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.17, 18. Oh, Beloved, for a Chriſtian to be ſtill in the enjoyment of all, as if he had nothing, this is right; to live in a conſtant dependance upon God as his All, and to make the creature but as the veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel or ciſtern through which God communicates himſelf: this is a true life; Such an one may ſay as <hi>Paul, I am dead, nevertheleſs I live; I am dead to the world, and the world is dead to me;</hi> ſuch an one lives upon God, a true life of happineſs and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent. But I ſay, this is hard and difficult: and our experience is a full demonſtration thereof: for ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to creature enjoyments ſo we live; for when the creature is full, and all things flow in ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to our deſire, then we are quiet, merry and glad, but when that is low and dry then we fail and flag. Few Chriſtians have and keep an even temper of ſpirit in fluctuating &amp; various con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions: for few live ſo upon God, as to make him their All; and therefore when the creature ebbs and flows, it carries them along in the ſtream, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther high or low: but this is to make God our por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, for Chriſtians to make a real diſtinction, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the enjoyment of God, and the enjoyment of the creature; ſo that when all goes, yet the heart is born up in the enjoyment of God, as <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bakkuk</hi>
                     <pb n="61" facs="tcp:62437:44"/>was; <hi>Hab.</hi> 3.17. And alſo when all is enjoyed,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Deut.</hi> 3.8, 10, 11.</note> God may have the glory and praiſe of all; <hi>Deut.</hi> 6.9, 10, 11. O Beloved, maintain a conſtant ſenſe of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine fulneſs upon your ſpirits; 'tis not enough for a Chriſtian to make God his All: and to know him to be ſo, but to preſent God thus always to his mind and ſpirit; What is it for a man to be worth a vaſt eſtate, if he be unmindful of it? though he be never ſo rich, yet he looks upon himſelf as poor, and ſo lives a dejected and a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſolate life; Thus it is with a Chriſtian; though he makes God his portion, yet if he be unmindful of God, his comfort will fade and fall. And ſo on the other ſide, when he is full of the creature, his heart will be too much elevated, and puffed up, if he forgetteth him who filleth all in all; forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs of God either raiſeth a man too high, or elſe caſts him down too low; he that forgets God, will either be proud or elſe deſpondent.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Is God your portion; then be content with ſuch things as you have, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.5. What though thou haſt not enough in the world, yet thou haſt enough in God; and though thou haſt not a ſelf-ſufficiency, yet thou haſt an All-ſufficiency; God is thine All. Let not this trouble thee, that the world can't be a God unto thee, or that thou haſt not all, that the world can afford thee in kind: for thou haſt more in God. Remember this, that the life of man conſiſts not in the abundance of riches, <hi>Luk.</hi> 12.15. Thou canſt neither live upon them, nor prolong thy life by them; thou canſt neither com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort thy ſelf with them, if God withdraws, nor increaſe them without his word of bleſſing; but
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:62437:45"/>contentation with a little is great riches, if God preſents himſelf to thee in it, as thine All. O therefore murmure not, repine not, fret not thy ſelf, becauſe the ſtream is low, when as thou haſt the fountain that can never be drawn dry.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Be not ſolicitouſly or diſtruſtfully careful for what you want; the preſence of God will fully ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply the abſence of any creature; thou haſt enough to live upon, when all created comforts fail thee: Hence is that of the Apoſtle, <hi>Phil.</hi> 4.6. God will not ſuffer thee to want any good that is needful for thee. <hi>Pſa.</hi> 34.9, 10. What thou canſt not enjoy in the creature, thou ſhalt enjoy in God himſelf. A Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians motto may be this; <hi>Nil habeo, nil careo, nil curo, I have nothing;</hi> ſelf-denyal hath outed me of all; all is to him as nothing: <hi>I want nothing;</hi> for he hath all in God: <hi>I take care for nothing;</hi> for he looks upon God for his proviſion. A carking ſolicitous man takes Gods office out of his hand: for God hath made it his work to take the care of his people; and hath made it their duty to be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for nothing, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.7. There is a double care.</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>1. <hi>Cura officii.</hi>
                     </item>
                     <item>2. <hi>Cura eventus.</hi>
                     </item>
                  </list>
                  <p>Firſt, There is a care of duty; and ſo every man is bound to labour in that calling wherein God hath ſet him carefully and induſtriouſly; 'Tis not only lawful, but our duty to make proviſions for back and belly, for our ſelves and others; So <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.17, &amp; 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.8.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, There is a care of event; and ſo we ought to be without care; we are to look at God for the event and iſſue of all, and for a bleſſing upon all; conſcience of duty, and faith in God, are
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:62437:45"/>to be inſeperably conjoyned; we muſt uſe the means and yet look beyond it. Neglect of means is diſobedience, and diſtracting care about the iſſue is infidelity; two rocks on which the ſoul is apt to ſplit, if not rightly ſteered by a Divine hand.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Is God your portion; then above all be thankful for the enjoyment of God; every gift that cometh down from God requires thanks? but much more when God gives thee himſelf; in every thing give thanks (ſaith the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 5.18.) <hi>For this is the will of God;</hi> but how much ſhould our hearts be enlarged with thanks and praiſe for the incomes of God himſelf? as the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of good is the object of thanks: ſo our thanks ſhould be proportioned to the good en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed; the higheſt good, ſhould have the higheſt praiſe; So <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 118.28. <hi>Thou art my God, I will praiſe thee, thou art my God, I will exalt thee.</hi>

                  <p n="1">1. That God is the Rock or Strength of an <hi>Iſraelites</hi> heart, and his portion for ever.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That Divine relief flows from God to his people, according to their neceſſity.</p>
                  <p>We have diſpatcht the firſt of theſe, and ſhall now proceed to the Second.</p>
                  <p>That Divine relief flows from God to his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple according to their neceſſity. When fleſh and heart faileth, then God is the ſtrength of their heart, and portion; When the old ſtock is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt ſpent, God renews it again; When the fire is almoſt out, he throws on new fewel; When the old houſe is falling upon our heads, he underprops it; When the Ciſtern fails, the Conduit ſhall run; In plain Engliſh, when a Chriſtian ſtands in great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:62437:46"/>need of relief and help, God will communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate the moſt of himſelf to him. God oftentimes leads his people, as he did <hi>Abraham,</hi> to the top of the mount of trials, temptations and afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and then appears to them in grace and goodneſs, that they may ſet up their ſtone and write <hi>Jehova Iireh</hi> upon it; the Lord will be ſeen.</p>
                  <p>Now for the more methodical handling this Doctrine, I ſhall do theſe three things.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Conſider the particular caſes, wherein a Chriſtian ſtands in need of relief.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Shew you how relief flows from God to Chriſtians in thoſe caſes.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Give you the grounds and reaſons there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, For the caſes wherein a Chriſtian ſtands in need of relief: and theſe are reducible to two heads, according to the Prophet here in our Text.</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>1. Failing of the fleſh.</item>
                     <item>2. Failing of the heart.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p>Firſt, Failing of the fleſh; and this is two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold.</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>1. When the comforts of a mans life fail him.</item>
                     <item>2. When the ſtrength of the outward man fails.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p>Secondly, There is a failing of the heart; and that is threefold,
<list>
                        <item>1. When the faculties of the ſoul fail, and cannot perform their due offices; either by way of apprehenſion, election or reten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</item>
                        <pb n="66" facs="tcp:62437:47"/>
                        <item>2. When the acquired or infuſed habits of the heart are weakned, or indiſpoſed to act.</item>
                        <item>3. When the animal ſpirits are expiring, and even breathing forth.</item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>This (as I hinted at the firſt in opening the Text) was the Prophets caſe, who pen'd this <hi>Pſalm;</hi> He was brought very love, even to the very pit, ready to die, ſoul and body failed; all without, and all within failed; and then God was the ſtrength of his heart, and his portion.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Therefore, we ſhall conſider the failing of the fleſh, and how Divine relief flows from God to a Chriſtian in that caſe.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, When the external comforts of a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans life fail him, as oftentimes they do; he is ſtript naked of all worldly and ſenſual glory, happineſs and comforts: diveſted, deplumed, and diſrob'd of all external delights, pleaſures, profits and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages whatſoever, which this life affords to render a mans ſenſitive life comfortable and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py. Why, this was <hi>Jobs</hi> caſe; God gave Satan a Commiſſion to ſeize on all that <hi>Job</hi> had; As you may ſee, <hi>Job</hi> 1.12. <hi>All that he hath is in thy power;</hi> God reſerved nothing for <hi>Job,</hi> but made Satan Lord of all he had; and accordingly he dealt with <hi>Job;</hi> he ſtript him of all to the ſhirt upon his back: as he could not go beyond his Commiſſion, ſo he would not come ſhort of it in one punctillo: but turn'd him out of all to the wide world, to ſhift for himſelf as he could.</p>
                  <p>Object. <hi>But ſome ſay, this was a ſingular caſe: we do not read of a parallel to it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> I anſwer, in ſome reſpects It may ſeem
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:62437:47"/>ſingular yet in other reſpects it hath been the por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of many of the people of God: 'tis true it is not common for God to give Satan ſuch a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion: but it is very uſual for God to ſtrip his people of their external comforts, and to reduce them to a very low and diſtreſſed ſtate: The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Habakkuk</hi> therefore propoſes ſuch a caſe to himſelf; <hi>Chap</hi> 3.17. The fig-tree ſhall nto bloſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, neither ſhall fruit be in the vines: the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour of the Olive ſhall fail, and the fields ſhall yield no meat, the flock ſhall be cut off from the fold, and there ſhall be no heard in the ſtalls: all means of lively-hood and ſubſiſtence cut off; a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect famine muſt needs follow. Now when a child of God is tried with this ſoar affliction, God is the ſtrength of his heart and his portion: and this made <hi>Habakkuk</hi> rejoyce; <hi>Yet I will rejoyce in the Lord, and joy in the God of my ſalvation;</hi> the Lord God is my ſtrength, <hi>i. e.</hi> what though this ſoar and moſt dreadful affliction comes, that all the comforts of our lives fail us, what though I have not a bit of bread to eat, nor a rag to cover my nakedneſs, nor any thing to ſuſtain nature with: yet as long as I have not loſt neither ſhall looſe my God, I am not troubled at it; he is the God of my Salvaion and of my ſtrength ſtill; I have a God to go to, when I have not a Field or Barn of Corn to go to for bread; and as long as I can go to God, I care not; ſo may a child of God ſay, I have a God to live upon when I have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in the world to live upon; I ſhall have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief from heaven in this ſtraight and exigency: <hi>He is the God of my ſalvation.</hi> For,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Then God gives in moſt of himſelf, when
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:62437:48"/>he ſtrips his people of external comforts, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes that to a Chriſtian, which the creature would be, if enjoyed; he is their life and ſtrength in the want of a livelyhood. It is impoſſible for all the creatures, if they were all collected into one body, to ſupply the room of God; but one God can ſupply the rooms of all the creatures in the world; And Saints then enjoy moſt of God, when they enjoy the leaſt of the world. As 'tis reported of a Muſitian, who having the hap to break one of his Harp-ſtrings in the middle of his Muſick; preſently a Graſhopper leap'd upon his Harp, and moſt melodiouſly ſupplyed the place of the broken ſtring. Thus it is with the people of God; No ſooner do they break a ſtring of their inſtrument, wherewith they make themſelves Muſick: No ſooner doth any created comfort fail them, but God ſteps in, and ſupplies the place thereof, and affords that to them, which the creature did; Though <hi>Jacob</hi> could not be a God to <hi>Rachel;</hi> yet God could be to <hi>Jacob</hi> in ſtead of a <hi>Rachel.</hi> As we are oftentimes furtheſt from God, both in affection, and affiance, when the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is preſent with us, ſo God comes the nigheſt to us, when the creature is ſet at the greateſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance from us; <hi>When my father and mother for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake me, the Lord will take me up;</hi> ſaith <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 27.10. It is a ſad pill to ſwallow, for a man to be forſaken of men, much more of near and intimate friends, but moſt of all, to be forſaken of father and mother; but is there no relief to be had in this caſe? Yes. When <hi>Davids</hi> father and mother forſook him, God took him up; God ſupplyed the place of a father and of a mother to
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:62437:48"/>him; Senſible withdrawings of the one, is joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with ſenſible manifeſtations of the other; It is Gods uſual way to make up our wants in the enjoyment of himſelf, and to be to us, inſtead of all things; We looſe the drop, and then are ſure of the fountain; God is that, and much more then the creature can be to us, when it is at the full, and in its greateſt ſtrength and glory. Now ſaith God to the ſoul, I will be thy All; now I will fill thee full of my ſelf, and inrich thee with the treaſure of an infinite being; Now I will make thee ſhine with a ſurpaſſing glory, and make thee ſparkle with the Gemms and Diamonds of mine own perfections; Now I will adorn thee with thoſe robes of beauty and amiableneſs, as ſhall out-ſhine the very ſun in the firmament, and make thee beautiful in mine own eye. And is not this a ſufficient relief in the want of all ſublunary comforts? Who would not be wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to part with the one for the other? And therefore,</p>
                  <p n="2">2. God is pleaſed to bow the heart to a free ſubmiſſion to Divine Will herein; ſo that it reſts ſatisfied, and content with its preſent ſtate and condition; Now contentment and ſatisfaction in an eſtate, be it never ſo low, and poor, makes it a comfortable and happy ſtate; What are riches if there be no contentment, but poverty? And what is poverty with contentment? Why, it is great riches; <hi>Godlineſs with contentment is great gain,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.6. A Chriſtian gains more, when God gives him a contented heart, then if God gave him a world without contentment; for all the world can't give him
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:62437:49"/>content; to know how to want, makes a man far more happy, then to be full. O when the ſoul can ſay, Lord, I thank thee, I have learned to be content; I have as much ſatisfaction and content, as if I enjoyed the greateſt riches and honours in the world; What though I have loſt all, and have but from hand to mouth, yet I am content herewith. I can ſtill bleſs thee, though thou haſt taken away all my out-ward bleſſings. So doth <hi>Job, The Lord hath given, and the Lord bath taken, bleſſed be the name of the Lord:</hi> Wants with a thankful, God-praiſing heart are a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er bleſſing, then fulneſs with an unthankful ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit; and it is a greater mercy for God to give a thankful ſpirit, in a low condition, then to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance a man to the higheſt pinnacle of outward proſperity in the world; This I ſay, is a bleſſed re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, that cauſeth the ſoul to bleſs God in the want of all outward comforts.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. When God is pleaſed to ſtrip a Chriſtian of all his outward comforts, he gives in a greater meaſure of faith, that he may depend upon God, for a ſupply; So that, though he hath nothing to live upon, yet he is ſure, he ſhall not want; for true faith, looks not at ſecondary cauſes ſo much as at the word of promiſe: and therefore if all means fail, yet as long as the promiſe fails not, a believing ſoul knows, that it ſhall have a ſupply, although it cannot imagine how or which way ſhe ſhall have it. Now inward ſupports in time of want, and ſecret intimations of a ſupply from God in his own way and time are a ſweet relief to the ſoul in that condition; So ſaith <hi>David, I had fainted, unleſs I had believed, to ſee the goodneſs of
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:62437:49"/>the Lord in the land of the living, Pſal.</hi> 27.13. True faith in God will keep the heart alive when a man hath nothing to live upon; and 'tis Gods way to fix a Chriſtian moſt upon the objects of faith, when the objects of ſenſe are removed from him; when a Chriſtian lives leaſt by fight then he lives moſt by faith. Now as a Chriſtian believes, ſo comfort flows in to him; Faith is to a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian in ſtead of all things; for it is the ſubſtance of things hoped for, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.1. What ever a man wants, yet if he believes truly, he hath the ſubſtance of that, which he hopes for; A Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian hopes for great things, greater comforts, more enlargments, and heaven at laſt. Why faith is the ſubſtance of all; He that lives by faith hath the ſubſtance of heaven to live upon; and that muſt needs be a ſweet relief to the ſoul, in a time of need. It is the Chriſtians comfort, that he hath a durable, and a laſting ſtate, that will never fail him; and that he hath a God to go to, that will not fail him; but will give him ſuch an allowance, as ſhall maintain him, till he comes to his journeys end, where he ſhall be put into a full poſſeſſion, and fruition of it.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Thoſe ſmall repaſts, which come from the hand of Divine Providence to uphold a Chriſtian under his wants, are filled ſo full of Divine Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing and ſtrength that he can truly ſay, I have enough. A man would think that pulſe and water would afford but little nouriſhment: I, but Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Bleſſing filled it full of ſtrength, that <hi>Daniel</hi> felt no want of better chear. Let a Raven be the Prophets Caterer, and if Divine Bleſſing attends the proviſion (as it did) he ſhall walk in the
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:62437:50"/>ſtrength thereof forty days, and not faint. Though poor Chriſtians in theſe days do not live upon Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine miracles, yet they live upon Divine wonders, that makes them ſometime wonder how they live; they cannot but ſee a Divine hand in giving what they have, and then in bleſſing it beyond expectation; for though they want much of that which others do enjoy, yet they enjoy that which others want: and this makes them healthful and chearful in their wants. There is many a poor Chriſtian, that hath more joy in one day, then thouſands that enjoy the treaſure of the earth; and why? It proceeds from this very ground; the good mans little is given in love, with a heart-chearing bleſſing: while the wicked mans plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful eſtate is given in wrath, and with a curſe upon it: hence is that of <hi>Solomon, Prov.</hi> 15.16. <hi>Better is a little with the fear of the Lord, then great treaſure and trouble therewith, i. e.</hi> they that fear the Lord, have not that trouble with their little, which they that do not fear the Lord have, with their great treaſure, and therefore the good mans little, is better then the wicked mans great treaſure. The good mans little comes with a bleſſing, for a bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing reſts upon a good man, and all that he hath be it little or much; Now a Divine bleſſing ever gives ſtrength and vertue to any means; Let it be never ſo poor and weak of it ſelf, yet Divine Bleſſing makes it mighty and effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious: ſo that it is no matter, what a Chriſtian hath to live upon, if the bleſsing of God goeth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long with it.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. When God ſtrips a good man of all he hath
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:62437:50"/>he then pours forth a mighty ſpirit of prayer for a fulneſs of grace to maintain the life of holineſs in this eſtate. He that hath nothing without to live upon, and but a ſmall ſtock of grace within will have much ado to rub through; and a gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious ſoul is ſenſible hereof, and therefore God is pleaſed to draw out the deſires of his ſoul, after a greater meaſure, then yet he hath attained; and indeed when outward wants meet with a ſoul that is full of grace, they do not make ſuch an impreſsion upon it, as when they meet with one, that hath but little; the empty veſſel makes the greateſt noiſe, and empty Chriſtians are fulleſt of complaints, until a ſpirit of prayer is poured forth upon them, whereby they attain an inward fulneſs: and this keeps and maintains a ſpirit of holineſs in them. I confeſs he that proſpers and thrives in the world, ſtands in need of a large mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of grace, to keep his heart holy in that eſtate, and ſo he that is low in the world, ſtands in need of a great meaſure of grace alſo, or elſe he may miſcarry. There is one eminent rock, upon which poor people are very apt to ſplit, and hazzard their immortal ſouls; and that is the uſe of indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect and unlawful means, for their relief and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence in the world; Hence is that prayer of <hi>Agur, Prov.</hi> 30.6, 7, <hi>give me neither poverty nor riches, feed me with food convenient for me, leaſt I be full, and deny thee, and ſay Who is the Lord? Or leaſt I be poor, and ſteal, and take the name of my God in vain.</hi> Mark this, leaſt I be poor and ſteal; Noting out, that poverty hath this tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion attending it, if grace prevents not; poor men will be prompted to uſe ſome indirect courſe
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:62437:51"/>for their ſubſiſtence; they'l ſteal, rather then want what they deſire; I, but a good man dare not do thus; This in him would be not only a breach of the eighth command, but alſo of the third; It is a taking the name of God in vain; for this is a certain truth, that whoſoever takes upon him the profeſſion of Chriſtian Religion, and yet de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parts not from iniquity, <hi>he takes the name of God in vain:</hi> now a true Chriſtian in whom the fear of the Lord is planted dreads this; and therefore crys mightily unto God to keep and preſerve him, that he may not do ſo unworthy an act, as to relieve himſelf by an indirect courſe; for he would not take the name of God upon him in vain; he had rather die then do it. Now when God hath thus drawn out the deſires of the ſoul after grace, then he gives in ſuch a meaſure as ſhall preſerve it, and keep it from yielding to the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation; and Beloved, it is a gratious relief to be kept in an holy and gratious frame of heart un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a ſtrong and powerful temptation: 'tis wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of a Chriſtians taking notice thereof; So doth the Prophet; this poor man cried, and the Lord heard him; <hi>Pſal.</hi> 34.6. Beloved, if you be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo poor, yet if God draws out your hearts after him in prayer, you ſhall be kept, that you ſhall not take any indirect courſe to help your ſelves, but be able to ſay, as <hi>David</hi> of himſelf, <hi>this poor man cried, and the Lord heard him.</hi> As prayer is the deſire of the ſoul, formed into requeſts and petitions, ſo crying is the importunity of the ſoul in prayer; Petitions and requeſts preſented to God with an humble and reverential boldneſs; it is a wreſtling with God for a bleſſing: a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeverance
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:62437:51"/>in prayer with an holy reſolution not to be put off. Now 'tis the poor that thus crys; ſenſe of want, that pinches the ſoul, joyned with ſome hopes of obtaining, makes the ſoul to cry, and he that crys ſhall be heard; Divine relief ſhall come in to help it, in this time of need. Thus you ſee how relief comes in to a good man in the want of all outward comforts.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, When the ſtrength of the outward man fails. And this is properly the failing of the fleſh, when a man is in a conſumptive condition; God ſmites the body and then the fleſh waſts, the beauty thereof fades, and the ſenſes grow dull, and heavy; The Prophet <hi>David</hi> had great ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience hereof: and therefore often mentions it in his <hi>Pſalms, Pſal.</hi> 38.10. <hi>my ſtrength faileth,</hi> and <hi>Pſal.</hi> 109.24. <hi>my fleſh faileth of fatneſs,</hi> and <hi>Pſal.</hi> 69.3. <hi>mine eyes fail; He was brought low; even to the mouth of the grave:</hi> but Divine relief came in; As you may ſee, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 116.6. <hi>I was brought low, and he helped me.</hi> God ſometimes raiſes a man from the very gates of death, and gives him a new life, reſtores him to his former health and ſtrength. But if God doth not thus by a gratious man, yet he ſhall have cauſe to ſay, the Lord is the ſtrength of my heart in this weak and low eſtate and condition. Divine relief ſhall be given to him,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. To ſupport and ſtrengthen him to bear his affliction with patience: the power and grace of God is wonderfully ſeen, in bearing up the ſpirits, when the body ſinks, and in giving grace to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe patience, under the pains and ſorrows of death; you have heard (ſaith Saint <hi>James</hi>) of
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:62437:52"/>the patience of <hi>Job, Jam.</hi> 5.11. As you heard of his corporal affliction, how ſoarly he was hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led; ſo you have heard of his patience, how gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiouſly he was he was ſupported, that he could bear his affliction without murmuring or repi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning: 'tis true it made him groan, I, but the ſtroke was heavier then his groaning, As he ſaith, <hi>Job</hi> 23.2. <hi>Even to day is my complaint bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, my ſtroke is heavier, then my groaning.</hi> The ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of a man will ſuſtain corporal infirmities, when God ſuſtains the ſpirit. Now patience un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der afflictions is equivalent to a deliverance from them; to be able to bear an affliction is as great a mercy, as to be freed from it; if God rebukes the feavour of impatiency, and thereby cures that, it is as much as to rebuke a bodily diſtemper, and thereby to cure it; So you may ſee, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.13. <hi>There hath no temptation taken you, but that which is common to man; but God is faithful, who will not ſuffer you to be tempted above that you are able: but will with the temptation alſo make a way to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ſcape, that ye may be able to bear it, i. e.</hi> I can aſſure you, that thus far you ſhall be ſet free from your temptations &amp; afflictions, that you ſhalbe able to bear them. This is a gratious relief; for there is no affliction, but impatiency makes a greater af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction: many afflict themſelves, when God doth not, and many afflict themſelves more, then God doth; their impatiency firſt makes their groaning heavier then their ſtroke, and then their ſtroke heavier then it is in it ſelf.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Divine relief and ſtrength comes into the heart of a good man in this conſumptive conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:62437:52"/>to renew the inward man as the outward man decays; So ſaith the Apoſtle, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.16. <hi>Though our outward man periſh, yet our inward man is renewed day by day.</hi> As God pulls down the old houſe, the houſe of clay, he frames and erects a new building, that ſhall abide for ever. So that a Chriſtian may ſay, as <hi>Peter Martyr</hi> ſaid when he was dying: <hi>My body is weak, my mind is well, well for the preſent, and it will be better for the future.</hi> The fleſh and ſpirit of a good man are like two buckets; when the fleſh goeth down, the ſpirit gets up; he is ever beſt within when he is worſt without; when the body is going down to the earth, from whence it came, the ſoul is aſcending to heaven, from whence it came; And you have a gratious promiſe for it; <hi>Pſal.</hi> 92.13, 14. <hi>Thoſe that be planted in the houſe of the Lord, ſhall flouriſh in the courts of our God. They ſhall ſtill bring forth fruit in their old age, they ſhall be fat and flouriſhing;</hi> Old age ſhall have green fruit upon it. When <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>he fleſh proves the moſt barren, the ſpirit is moſt fruitful: a true Chriſtian never flouriſheth ſo much, as when old age hath nipt the fleſh; and it is a lovely ſight, to ſee gray hairs, a conſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive body, and a withered face, fat and flouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in Holineſs and Righteouſneſs; to ſee Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer-fruit, upon an old tree in Winter-time: and yet thus it is with good Chriſtians; their Winter of old age is their moſt flouriſhing time. When nature is moſt ſpent, grace comes to its greateſt ſtrength and perfection; Faith ſtrongeſt, love to God and Chriſt moſt enflamed, hope moſt lively, and holineſs moſt beautiful and ſparkling;
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:62437:53"/>the greateſt beauty in the ſoul, when the body is turning to rottenneſs and putrifaction: When the natural breath ſmells of the earth, the ſpiritual breath ſavours moſt of heaven; the eye of the ſoul moſt clear in diſcerning ſpiritual and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly things, when the eye of the body grows dim and dark; the hand of faith moſt ſteady to take hold on Divine promiſes, when the corporal hand ſhakes with the palſie, and the feet of the ſoul run faſteſt towards the mark, for the price of the high calling in Chriſt, when the bodily feet cannot move; So true it is, that a Chriſtian may ſay as S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid, <hi>When I am weak, then am I ſtrong;</hi> weak in my outward man, but ſtrong in the inward.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Divine relief comes in to the heart of a good man in a conſumptive condition, to conſume, waſte, and deſtroy that body of death, that he carries about him. Bodily weakneſs, and ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ſanctified, is purgative: that as the body waſts and conſumes ſo ſin waſts and conſumes; for God will not ſuffer ſin to outlive a Saint; ſin ſhall not enter into heaven with a Saint, for that would marr his joy there, as well as here: And therefore God firſt purges that out, before the ſoul can enter in; corruption cannot inherit in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corruption; though God doth crown the grace of a Saint with glory; yet he will not crown the ſin and corruption of a Saint with glory. Heaven is an holy, and glorious place, and will not hold any but holy and pure ones: 'tis the pure in heart, that ſhall ſee God: Heaven is a place for none but triumphants: for ſuch as have fought the good fight of faith, and won the field, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:62437:53"/>Sin, Satan, and the World, and put them to flight: I, but here a Chriſtian is militant, and muſt encounter theſe three potent Adverſaries; let him but worſt theſe, and then he will not fear Death, though it be the King of terrors, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſerved for the laſt. In this, now, the power of grace is clearly ſeen; for that directs the Arrow that Death ſhoots at the outward man, that it ſhall ſtrike through the very heart of Sin, Satan, and the World; that theſe ſhall be dead to him, as well as he dead to them. No ſooner doth a good man feel a wound in his body, but if ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, if grace flows in, ſin is wounded alſo, that lies a bleeding in him. This is that which makes the children of God to rejoice in bodily weakneſs and inſirmities; becauſe (when ſanctified through grace) it is a means to weaken the power of ſin in them. For a true Chriſtian bears an unfeigned and implacable hatred againſt Sin; and therefore like to <hi>Sampſon,</hi> can be content that the houſe may be plucked upon his own head, that his enemy Sin, may die with him. It is with the body ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual, as in the body natural; there are ſome Diſeaſes that muſt be ſtarved out; ſo long as the body is pampered, the diſeaſe is nouriſhed; it muſt be brought very low, or there will be no cure. 'Tis ſo with the body ſpiritual; there are ſome ſins in good men, that muſt be ſtarv'd out. So long as there is ſtrength in the outward man, they will be ſtirring and active: God therefore is pleaſed to bring the Body low, that the Soul may get maſtery and power over them. Or like to ſome Rebels in a Caſtle, that will never yield, as long as any Proviſion is left: 'Tis ſo with Sin, it will
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:62437:54"/>not yield, as long as corrupted Nature yields any Proviſion to it. And hence it is, that ſickly and weakly Chriſtians, are the moſt mortified Chriſtians.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. When a good man is in a conſumptive con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, and begins to put one foot in the grave; it pleaſeth God to give in ſuch clear evidence of his love to him, and ſo full an aſſurance of his intereſt in eternal life, that he even longs for a diſſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. He was a child of Grace, and an Heir be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; but now God makes him an Heir apparent. Now ſo clear a light ſhines into his Soul, as doth manifeſt his adoption and Sonſhip; ſo that he can cry Abba, Father, which he could not do before. I deny not, but a true child of God, may die in a cloud, and not fee the light of life, untill it comes in Heaven: I, but it is not alwaies thus; but ſometimes God is pleaſed to reveal his well plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed face to the Soul at the laſt, and not before; that ſhe can ſay, He is come, he is come. Some Chriſtians are like to Swans, that never ſing, but a little before their death; their comforts and joyes come in at the laſt. The Holy Ghoſt is the Guardian of a Chriſtians comforts, and ſometimes he deals with them, as a Guardian doth with an Heir, who is committed to his truſt: When the Heir is come to age, and is to enter upon his Eſtate; then the Guardian gives him in his Evidences to preſerve and keep himſelf. Even ſo ſometimes, when a Chriſtian is to enter upon the Inheritance of Eternal Life; the Holy Ghoſt throws him in Evidences for it, that he may carry them along with him thither. 'Tis true, 'tis the duty of all Chriſtians, to give all diligence to
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:62437:54"/>make their Calling and Election ſure; but ſome are fain to wait a long time, before they can attain to this comfort; and then when they are leaving Earth, they have a glimpſe of Heaven. When their earthly houſe of this tabernacle is crumbling down upon their heads, then God ſhews them his Building, <hi>An Houſe not made with Hands, eternal in the Heavens;</hi> and this is a gratious re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief to a dying Chriſtian, for it is a beginning of Heaven, to have a ſight of Heaven; it is comfort enough to have an aſſurance and evidence of theſe unſpeakable joyes, into which the Soul e're long ſhall enter. The Soul may then ſay, as he ſaid, when he lay upon his death-bed, putting his hand to his heart, <hi>Hic ſat lucis,</hi> Here is light enough. This is that which makes ſicknes and weakneſs ſo ſweet to a Chriſtian: For though the Rod ſmarts, yet he taſtes Honey at the end of it; that opens his eyes, as it did the eyes of <hi>Jonathan,</hi> to ſee the ſalvation of God: It is a moſt ſoveraign antidote againſt the ſting of death, that it can't kill or deſtroy the Soul, although it doth the Body. No meſſenger is more welcome than this, that comes to call him home.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. In all the weakneſs and conſumptive condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a good man, God doth act the part of a tender-hearted Nurſe to him; and doth tend him even as a Nurſe doth a bed-rid perſon, who is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to her care; and is not this much? Surely he ſhall be admirably well lookt to, whom God tends. Now that God doth thus, is clear, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 41.3. <hi>The Lord will ſtrengthen him upon the bed of lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing, thou wilt make all his bed in his ſickneſs.</hi> The <hi>Hebrew</hi> ſignifies to turn, and ſo <hi>Arias Montanus</hi>
                     <pb n="82" facs="tcp:62437:55"/>renders it. As Bed-makers uſe to turn and toſs the Bed to and fro, that it it may be eaſie and ſoft to lie upon, ſo doth God deal with a good man, when he layes him upon the bed of languiſhing; he mitigates and moderates the affliction, that it may not be ſo painful and terrible to him, as elſe it would be. No Nurſe can do that for a ſick and weak perſon, that God can and doth for a good man. When a Nurſe hath turn'd the Bed, and made it as ſoft as ſhe can, that the ſick man finds a little eaſe and refreſhment; yet the Bed will quickly grow hard again, and the man as weary of it as before. But when God comes to make the Bed in our ſickneſs, he moderates the pain, and gives reſt to the bones. Many a time, when thoſe that are about him, ſtand weeping over him, to hear his groans, and to ſee him toſs and tumble in his Bed, and know not how to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford him any relief; firſt they turn him to one ſide, and then to another, but the man finds no reſt; then God ſteps in, gives a word of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, and that layes him to reſt, refreſheth and revives him: in an inſtant the pain and ſickneſs is removed, and the man thinks himſelf in a new world.</p>
                  <p>Thus you ſee how divine relief comes in to Chriſtians, in the time of their greateſt corporal weakneſs, when they are ready to deſpair of all help therein. Sometimes by divine ſupports inabling to bear it with patience; as alſo by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newing the inward man, and making that to thrive and flouriſh. Sometimes ſo ſanctifying it, as that it proves the effectual death and decay of the old man in him. Sometimes giving him a
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:62437:55"/>ſweet foretaſt of Heaven, in clearing up the evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of Gods love to him: and ſometimes by mitigating and moderating the pain and grief wherewith he is afflicted. In ſome, or all theſe wayes, good men have experience of the incomes of divine relief in this condition.</p>
                  <p>And thus much for the firſt particular, wherein I have ſhewn you, how God is the ſtrength of a Chriſtians heart, when the fleſh faileth.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Let us conſider the failing of the Heart, and ſee how divine relief comes into a good man in this caſe. Now this failing of the Heart, I reduced to three Heads.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The failing of the natural faculties; and that either by way of Apprehenſion, or Election, or Retention. I call them Natural Faculties, although they are ſanctified and changed: for Grace doth not alter and change the eſſence of the Soul, but only the quality and inclination thereof. Now, though they are thus altered, yet they may fail a man in whom true grace is,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. In reſpect of Apprehenſion: The Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding is the eye of the Soul, whereby it ſeeth, and diſcerneth ſpiritual objects; I, but ſometimes the eye grows dim, ſo that though he be a child of light, yet he may walk in darkneſs, as you have it, <hi>Eſ.</hi> 50.10. <hi>Who is there among you, that feareth the Lord, that walketh in darkneſs and hath no light?</hi> Sometimes God is pleaſed to withdraw, or cloud up the light, and then though the eye be open, yet the ſoul is in the dark; the day of divine diſcoveries and manifeſtations may be turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into a dark night: But ſometimes the light ſhineth clearly upon the Soul, and yet for want
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:62437:56"/>of a capacity to receive it, the Soul is in the dark ſtill: as when the eye is ſhut, a man ſeeth no more, then he doth, when the light is withdrawn from him; and this was the caſe of the Pen-man of this Pſalm, as he confeſſeth of himſelf, <hi>ver.</hi> 22. <hi>So fooliſh was I, and ignorant, I was as a beaſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thee.</hi> You know, whatever light of Reaſon is offered to a bruit, it receiveth it not; becauſe it is beyond its faculty and power: Read a Lecture of Philoſophy to it, and render it as plain as it can be made, yet it underſtands nothing thereof. Even thus the Prophet complains of himſelf, That he was as a Bruit, that underſtood not. It was not for want of light ſhining, but for want of a ſeeing eye. He could not receive the light, and therefore was very much in the dark, and that in reference to three things,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. In reſpect of his own ſpiritual ſtate, and therefore miſtook that. He thought it bad, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it was good; for ſo he ſaith, <hi>ver.</hi> 13. <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily I have cleanſed my hands in vain, and waſhed my hands in innocency,</hi> i. e. All my Religion is to no purpoſe; it doth not at all advantage me, that I have lived ſtrictly according to the commands of God; I might have ſpared a great deal of pains, that I have taken to cleanſe my heart, and to waſh my hands, and have ſped as well. For notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all this, <hi>I have been plagued all the day long, and chaſtened every morning,</hi> ver. 14. Surely, had God loved me, had I belonged to him, he would never have dealt thus with me.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. In reference to the ſpiritual ſtate of others; and therefore miſtook that. He thought the ſtate of the fooliſh better then his own, becauſe they
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:62437:56"/>ſeemed to proſper, <hi>ver.</hi> 3. <hi>For I was envious at the fooliſh, when I ſaw the proſperity of the wicked.</hi> As he concluded his own eſtate bad, ſo he concluded their's good: He was ſo miſtaken, that he could have been content to have exchanged ſtates with them; and yet had he done ſo, he had made a bad bargain for himſelf.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. In reference to God's mind, touching his duty under this complexed providence, he knew not what to do; but was at a great loſs, exceedingly bewildred in his own thoughts through that dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, that had overſpread his underſtanding; and nothing leſs can be implied in theſe words, <hi>I was as a beaſt before thee,</hi> i. e. I knew not how to carry, or behave my ſelf toward God; but acted very ſtrangely and prepoſterouſly, as one that had no command of himſelf, or of his paſſions: and this is the caſe ſometimes of God's dear children; they are ſo darkened in their Spirits, as that they know neither how to judge of things, nor how to act under divine diſpenſations. And hence flow miſapprehenſions of themſelves, falſe concluſions of divine providence, and croſs actings to divine will.</p>
                  <p>Thus you ſee this particular caſe; Let us now ſee, what divine relief flows into the Soul herein.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. In time of the greateſt darkneſs that is upon the Spirit of a Chriſtian, when 'tis dark night with him, when he meets with the darkeſt and moſt croſs diſpenſation of divine providence, that he concludes againſt himſelf, and the goodneſs of his eſtate; then God is bringing about ſome glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious eminent deſign for his good. The more glorious any deſign of God is, and the more it
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:62437:57"/>tends to the good of any Soul, the more it is kept ſeccret, and the leſs the Soul diſcerns it, until it be wrought out. There is many a good man that fears, that God is ſetting himſelf in battel array againſt him, and ſhooting the arrows of his diſpleaſure and indignation at him, and that the full vials of his wrath ſhall be poured forth upon him; and yet at that time, God is bringing about ſome eminent deſign of good for him. It may be, thou art queſtioning thy eſtate, and concludeſt againſt thy ſelf, but God is about to clear it up to thee: Thou doubteſt of God's love, and he is making way for the manifeſtation of it. Thou art labouring under ſtrong temptations, and conflicts with ſtrong corruptions: I, but God is giving in a glorious conqueſt, and treading Satan under thy feet; that which thou feareſt will prove thy de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, ſhall be thy ſalvation. God often works (as <hi>Luther</hi> ſaith) <hi>in mediis contrariis,</hi> by contrary means: God heals by wounds, and makes alive by killing; ſo that a Chriſtian may ſay, as he ſaid; I had been undone, if I had not been undone. The iſſue is good, although the means ſeem never ſo croſs. This is excellently ſet forth under a type, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 1.16. <hi>And their appearance and their work, was as it were, a wheel in the middle of a wheel,</hi> i. e. very croſs, and intangled one in another; one goes one way, and another goes another way; and yet all perform one and the ſame work. Thus is the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence of God, it is often very croſs and complex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, it works by croſs and intangled means; yet carries on one glorious deſign. All theſe croſs ways and means work together (as the Apoſtle ſaith) <hi>for the good of them that love God,</hi> Rom. 8.28.</p>
                  <pb n="87" facs="tcp:62437:57"/>
                  <p n="2">2. When a Chriſtian is moſt in the dark, yet he ſhall not want a ſecret, (though inſenſible) con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of Gods Holy Spirit, that ſhall ſecure him from ruine in his way; It is a notable relief to a blind man, to have a ſure guide: God is a ſure guide to a good man, when he is unable to direct himſelf. Alaſs, no man is able to guide himſelf, without the aſſiſtance of Gods Holy Spirit; So <hi>Jer.</hi> 10.23. <hi>O Lord I know that the way of man is not in himſelf, it is not in man that walketh, to direct his ſteps.</hi> Why how then ſhall he eſcape ruine and deſtruction, when ſo many ſnares and rocks are in his way? See that <hi>Pſal.</hi> 37.23. <hi>The ſteps of a good man are ordered by the Lord.</hi> God goeth along with a good man, and orders him in every ſtep he takes: though we cannot ſee a ſtep of our way, yet if we take God with us, he will direct us: I will guide thee with mine eye; <hi>Pſal.</hi> 32.8. <hi>His eye is open upon the righteous, and he will guide them in the right way, even then when they cannot ſee their way before them:</hi> and therefore is that counſel of <hi>Solomon, In all thy ways acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge him, and he ſhall direct thy paths, Prov.</hi> 3.5, 6. As God orders the ſteps of a good man, ſo he orders the ways of a good man; It may be, thou art apt to walk in one way, and God will put thee into another, where thou ſhalt find the greateſt comfort and peace; we never walk ſo ſafely, as when God takes the ſole care of us. When <hi>Abraham</hi> followed God in the darkneſs of ſenſe and reaſon, not knowing whither he went, his courſe was never better ſteered: and often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times we do beſt, when we know not what to do; when we are at the greateſt ſtand, our reaſon
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:62437:58"/>darkned, and our ſpirits perplexed, and all the ways we can imagine of true peace and comfort block'd up, and we know not where to ſet one foot forward, then God comes and takes us by the hand, and leads us into ſuch a way as we dream't not of, where our deſired peace and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort is prepared for us; There is an excellent pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe for this purpoſe: <hi>Eſay</hi> 35.8. <hi>And an high way</hi> ſhall be <hi>there, and a way, and it ſhall be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the way of holineſs, the unclean ſhall not paſs over it, but it ſhall be for thoſe: the way faring men, though fools ſhall not erre</hi> therein. Obſerve firſt, God makes out a way for good men to walk in, an high way, <hi>Via Regia,</hi> the Kings way, the way of God, an holy way, or the way of holineſs; ſin and wickedneſs is not Gods way. Secondly, <hi>fools ſhall not erre therein, i. e.</hi> the people of God ſometimes are much in the dark, and know not what to do in a particular caſe: I, but yet they ſhall be guided, that they ſhall not looſe their way; but how ſhall they be guided? Why God will be with them; and ſo that paſſage may be read; for he ſhall be with them; In our tranſlation it is rendered, but it ſhall be for thoſe; but it may be read thus, but he, <hi>i. e.</hi> God ſhall be to them, or with them; to conduct and guide them in their way. How many Chriſtians have cauſe to bleſs God and ſay, I could never have found the way to peace and comfort, had not God been my guide? This very experience brought the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet to that confidence for the future; As you may ſee in the ſecond verſes before my Text, <hi>Pſa.</hi> 73.24. <hi>Thou ſhalt guide me with thy counſel, and afterward receive me to glory.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="91" facs="tcp:62437:58"/>
                  <p n="3">3. When a Chriſtian is in the dark, God is ſo far the ſtrength of his heart, that he can wait for light. When they know not what to do, nor what to think, yet they can wait for light; they are expectants; And now Lord, what wait I for? My hope is in thee, ſaith <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 39.7. <hi>My ſoul waiteth for the Lord, more then they that watch for the morning, Pſal.</hi> 130 7. As a man that hath a long journey to go, upon very great and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant buſineſs, how doth he watch for the morning, becauſe the darkneſs of the night ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpends his motion; I, but <hi>David</hi> waited more for the Lord, then a traveller watcheth for the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; or as the words may be read, as they that watch unto the morning; and ſo he makes a compariſon between himſelf and watchmen, <hi>i. e.</hi> There is no watchman doth more obſerve, and wait for the breaking forth of the light of the day, then I do wait for the Lord. And this is a bleſſed relief to the ſoul, to be put into a waiting po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture. When the ſoul knows not what to do, yet it can wait for light; Not like <hi>Saul, And, why ſhould I wait for the Lord any longer;</hi> But as <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid, I waited patiently for the Lord, Pſal.</hi> 40.1. Though a good heart will not let God wait long; No, nor at all (willingly) for obedience, yet he is willing to wait as long as God ſeeth good for light to guide him in his obedience; loath is a gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious heart to miſcarry in his work, or to tread awry, or ſtep out of Gods way, and therefore he will wait for light; glad would he be of one beam of light, to clear up his ſpiritual ſtate to him; I, but he knows that Gods time is the beſt; It is ſad to him to be in the dark, yet he knows
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:62437:59"/>that none can ſcatter the cloud, that overſpreads him but God; and therefore he concludes with the Prophet, It is good both to wait, and to hope in the Lord.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Though a good man may be in the dark, yet God will not always leave him in the dark; Unto the upright, there ariſeth light in the dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 112.4. Oftentimes when they leaſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect it, then it ariſeth; as the night is darkeſt a little before the day breaks: ſo when the thickeſt cloud hath overſpread the ſoul, then God cauſeth light to ſpring forth: Even as it was with Saint <hi>Paul</hi> in another caſe, 2 <hi>Corinth.</hi> 1.8, 10. We were preſſed out of meaſure above ſtrength, inſomuch that we deſpaired of life, but we had the ſentence of death in our ſelves, that we ſhould not truſt in our ſelves, but in the living God, who delivered us from ſo great a death. When his condition was at the heighth, when nothing could help or relieve him, but he was at the very point of death, then God revived him; Even ſo it is in this caſe, when the darkneſs of the ſoul is at the heighth, and the ſoul is at the greateſt loſs and plunge, no way open for its comfort and relief, then God gives in ſome beam of Divine light to guide and direct it unto peace and comfort; for though it be the portion of good men, and of children of light ſometimes to walk in dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, yet they are never caſt into utter darkneſs; eternal darkneſs is not their portion, they ſhall not lie down in darkneſs: light is ſown for the righteous, and as God hath his ſeeds time, ſo they ſhall have their harveſt; let the ſoul be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo full of fears, and perplexity of ſpirit,
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:62437:59"/>yet this cloud ſhall vaniſh, theſe fears ſhall be ſcattered; and the ſoul ſhall ſee and know, that it is under the gratious diſpenſation of a moſt gratious God, who hath ordered all things for her peace here, and eternal well-fare here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after. This is clear in our Text; the Prophet had been in darkneſs; I, but God had brought him forth into the light, and now he is able to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect his miſtakes.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. That experimental light and knowledge, which a ſanctified ſoul gains in the time of its darkneſs, and from the flowing in of Divine Light to ſcatter that darkneſs, affords the ſoul un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable joy and ſatisfaction: that ſhe accounts it a ſufficient recompence for all her trouble and ſorrow in the want thereof. As there is know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of things by principles, ſo there is a know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, that ariſeth from experience; and it would be very ſtrange, if the ſoul ſhould gain no expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rimental knowledge by the incomes of Divine Relief in the time darkneſs. S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulation worketh patience, and patience experience.</hi> Hereby the ſoul knoweth more of God, and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains clearer apprehenſions of him, then it had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, when ſhe is able to ſay, 'Tis true I was in darkneſs, but then God carried on a glorious de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of doing me good, all though I could not ſee it; I was blind and not able to guide my feet in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the way of peace, but I had the conduct of Gods Holy Spirit; I was very much perplexed in my Spirit, but Divine ſtrength kept me up in a waiting frame; Yea, I found at laſt, light break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in upon me in the darkeſt night; my dark night was turned into a bright ſhining day. Now
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:62437:60"/>this experience muſt needs fill the ſoul full of raviſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing joy and ſatisfaction; that ſhe may ſay as <hi>David, Return unto thy reſt, O my ſoul, for the Lord hath dealt bountifully with thee;</hi> and this is one mair. end of Gods drawing a cloud over the eye of a Chriſtian, that he may have ſome experience of Gods grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous dealing with him in this condition, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by attain a fuller knowledge of the ways of God, then he did before. I confeſs it may ſeem ſtrange, but 'tis true, that a Chriſtian gains light by the darkneſs of his ſpirit. Did not the light of a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian fail him, he would never have ſuch experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of Divine Relief, as now he hath. This makes his light double to what he had before: he had the light of inſtruction before, but now he hath the light of experience: and hence it is, that thoſe Chriſtians who have had the greateſt clouds upon their ſpirits prove the moſt knowing Chriſtians; for experience is the miſtreſs of truth; and when the ſoul is taught by experience, it knows the truth indeed. Now the ſoul is put out of all doubt; there is no room for queries about it; ſhe is fully ſatisfied in it. Many times when God goeth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to teach a man by his word, and reads him a Lecture of Divine Promiſes made to the Soul in ſuch and ſuch a condition, he little minds it: but when God teaches him by his works in fulfilling thoſe promiſes, then he cannot but ſit down and admire at the riches of Gods grace, that God ſhould deal thus with ſo vile and wretched a crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture as he is.</p>
                  <p>Thus you have ſeen how Divine Relief flows in to the Soul of a good man, when his underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fails him.</p>
                  <pb n="95" facs="tcp:62437:60"/>
                  <p n="2">2. A ſecond particular caſe is in point of Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. It cannot be denied, that as the appetite of all men is carried out to that which is good, ſo the appetite of a good man is fixed upon the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt good, and the ultimate end: But then it muſt be granted, that there is ſometimes a failing of the Will, both in point of Liberty, and alſo in point of Domination.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. In point of Liberty, which conſiſts chiefly in making choice of ſuch means, as are moſt proper for attaining that end.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. In point of Dominion, which lies in im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploying all inferiour faculties for execution of thoſe means.</p>
                  <p>Now the failing of the Will in both theſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects is, when the Will falls into a kind of he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitancy, or indifferency, and begins to halt. God hath appointed proper means for the attaining this end; but the Soul may be at a ſtand at ſome time, and not determined. Every good man can't ſay at all times with the Prophet, <hi>My Heart is fixed.</hi> It may be fixed as to the end, but not as to the means: There may be at ſome time a wavering in the Will about it; Chriſtians find it ſo by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. When the ſtrength of Reſolution is not ſo powerful, as to ſtand out againſt all aſſaults, and to bear down all oppoſition. The Will may be fixt, but not ſo firmly as it ought to be; there may be a giving ground for a time to our ſpiritual adverſary, a ſmall retreat in time of temptation. A Chriſtian never yields to a temptation of Satan, but there is at leaſt a weakneſs in his Reſolution, and ſome preſumption in his Will, againſt which <hi>David</hi> prayed, Pſ. 19.</p>
                  <pb n="94" facs="tcp:62437:61"/>
                  <p n="3">3. When the Will grows cold and dead; there is not that vigour or activity, as ought to be put forth in the uſe of means; his heart fails him, when as he grows like a ſilly Dove without heart; he prayes, and hears, and confers, but in all with a dead and lazy Spirit.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. When the Will is fickle and inconſtant; 'tis in and out, and keeps not in one tenor and frame, but like a broken Bow, that ſoon ſtarts aſide.</p>
                  <p>This, this is the ſpiritual plague and diſtemper of a good heart. Now let us ſee the remedy and relief that flows from God, for the cure hereof.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, God is pleaſed to cure this ſad diſtemper, by diſcovering the evil that is in it. The failing of the Will is a greater evil, and is far worſe, than the failing of the Underſtanding. The more there is of Will in the commiſſion of Sin, and the leſs there is of Will in the performance of Duty, the greater is the Sin. Other wants of the Soul will ſooner be paſſed by in a duty, then the want of Will; and therefore when God ſets upon the cure of this diſtemper, he firſt opens the wound, and ſhews the filth that is in it, <hi>i. e.</hi> he convinceth a Chriſtian of the greatneſs, and heinouſneſs of the ſin. It is poſſible for a Chriſtian that is ſound and upright in the main, to have ſo great a failing in his Will, that for a time he may but jog on in the way of God, that other Chriſtians outſtrip him far that ſet out long after him, and yet he may be very inſenſible thereof, until God is pleaſed to ſtrike a dart of ſpiritual conviction through his very heart; and this wakens and rouzes him up, and makes him beſtir himſelf, and conſider where he is, and what he hath been doing all this while.
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:62437:61"/>A clear place for this you have, <hi>Cant.</hi> 5.2. <hi>I ſleep but my heart waketh: it is the voice of my beloved, that knocketh, ſaying, open to me, my ſiſter.</hi> This is the ingenuous confeſſion of the Church, wherein ſhe acknowledgeth that carnal deadneſs and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity, that had overtaken her; I ſleep, or I have been aſleep. Now a Chriſtian never ſleeps ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually, or in a ſpiritual ſenſe, but when his Will flags and fails; when that falls to a kind of indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferency, or is not ſtrongly bent and inclined, but grows cold and dead, which is the ſymptome of a ſleepy man. I, but did Chriſt ſuffer his Spouſe to lie in this ſleepy ſtate? No! See how he awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens and rouzes her up, he calls to her, and bids her open to him; whereby, he let in a beam of divine light, and convinc'd her of her ſin, and this was the firſt ſtep to her cure, this made her open her eyes; as when a man awakes out of ſleep, he firſt opens his eyes, and then he riſes. So 'tis with a ſleepy and dull Chriſtian: God's firſt work upon him is to open his eyes, that he may ſee his ſin, and be affected with it, and this will make him ſtir. O beloved, it may be you do not know the evil that is in a ſleepy eſtate, the ſin that is inindiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rency and halting in the waies of God, and in the weakneſs of your Reſolution to walk therein; you take little notice it may be, of the coldneſs and deadneſs of your hearts unto holy duties, or of the fickleneſs and inconſtancy of your Spirits in them; but at one time or other, you muſt expect a Soul-awakening voice, that will make you open your eyes, and then you will ſee how great a ſin it is. What though thou doſt not caſt off the waies of God, yet this heartleſsneſs in them is ſin enough
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:62437:62"/>(if God ſhould charge thee with it) to ſink thy Soul as low as Hell.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, God cures this ſleeping evil, by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viving and renewing the inſcription and impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Divine Law upon the heart. A good man never grows dull and dead, but when Divine Law is not in its full ſtrength and power upon the heart. As this is a means of divine life, ſo it is a reſtorer and renewer of life. When the heart is exceeding dead, and indiſpoſed to any thing that is good, this can quicken it; and hence is that of <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 119.93. <hi>It is a bleſſed thing for a dead and dull heart to be quickned unto, and in the way of God:</hi> But this will not be, unleſs the word of God come with life and power upon the heart. And this effect is worth remembring, and a good man will ſay with <hi>David, I will never forget thy Precepts, for with them thou haſt quickned me.</hi> It may be thou goeſt to read or hear the word, with a dead and dull Spirit, and by that God quickens thee: Oh, remember it, and never forget it. It was a great and wonderful mercy to thee, that God did write his Law upon thy heart, when he firſt brought thee under the bond of his everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Covenant; and then bowed and inclined thy heart to a ready and free obedience thereunto. It was a day of power, when he made thee willing to take his yoak upon thee. And it is a great mercy, that he is pleaſed to revive and renew the characters of this divine and heavenly Law upon thy Spirit, when they ſeemed to be obliterated and blotted out; when thou hadſt almoſt loſt the power and life thereof upon thy Spirit, that there was little ſtirring or moving in thy Will towards
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:62437:62"/>Heaven. God deals with a Chriſtian, as a man deals with his Watch; when it goeth dull, and begins to beat ſlowly, he gets the Spring, which is the principle of its motion, mended and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed: So when the heart of man grows dull and heavie, his motions very cold and dead unto any good, God mends and renews the Will, which is the ſpring and principle of motion in the heart; and for that end, he ſets Divine Law and will to work upon it. When God's Will moves upon our Will, then 'tis quick and liuely in its motions towards God, not elſe; if that be dead towards him, the man is dead to any thing that is good. I know the Law, as it is a Covenant of Works, is a killing Inſtrument; it ſlew Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> and laid him a bleeding before God: but as it is a Covenant of Grace, ſo it is a quickning Inſtrument, and ſets the Soul a going after God, in the uſe of thoſe means which he hath appointed.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Sometimes God cures this ſad diſtemper, by ſhedding his love abroad upon the heart: Divine Love is both a heart-quickner, and a heart-in-flamer. <hi>We</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>love him, becauſe he loved us firſt,</hi> 1 Jo. 4.19. Our love is but the reflex of his. Gods love to us is founded in it ſelf. He loves, becauſe he will love; but our love to God, is founded on his love. Nothing in us moved him to love us; but God's love to us, moves us to love him: and therefore it is, that as God manifeſts his love to us, ſo we are able to love him; <hi>The love of Chriſt conſtraineth us,</hi> 1 Cor. 5.17. As when the Sun ſhineth, then Flowers open; ſo when the love of God ſhines upon the Soul,
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:62437:63"/>it opens to God: then the Heart is enlarged for God, the Will is carried out with high reſolutions to follow him fully in all the waies of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands. As the hiding of Gods face is a great damp upon the Spirit, that makes it drive on very heavily in the way of God; ſo the ſhining of his face, is a notable quickner of the Spirit: it is like oil to the wheel, that helps on the motion with greater eaſe. When once a Soul hath taſted the love of God, and got ſome ſenſe thereof, the pulſe of holy deſires, will begin to beat ſtrong af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the enjoyment of him; it is impoſſible for a Chriſtian to remain dead, under the warm beams of this moſt glorious Sun. It is very obſervable, that no ſooner did God call to <hi>Iſrael</hi> to return, with a gracious promiſe, <hi>of healing their back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlidings, and of pardoning their iniquities:</hi> But they anſwer, <hi>Behold, we come unto thee, for thou art the Lord our God.</hi> Though their Hearts were turned even quite away from God, and their Wills ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding averſe from returning; yet that expreſſion of Love and Grace to them, preſently turned the bent and frame of their Spirits, and quickned them to a ſpeedy return. <hi>Behold, we come unto thee, for thou art the Lord our God;</hi> as you may ſee, <hi>Jer.</hi> 3.22. And therefore it is that a gracious Soul longs for the ſenſe and manifeſtations of Gods love; not only for the peace and comfort that it brings along with it, but becauſe he knows that it a is quickner of his Heart and Will, to a cheerful performance of obedience unto God. 'Tis that which begets a free Spirit in the Soul; renders it ready and prompt unto all holy ſervice: And now ſet God call him to what he pleaſeth, and he ſtands
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:62437:63"/>ready preſt to do it. God hath now (as it were) a ſtring upon his heart, he may lead him about whither he will.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Sometimes God cures the failing of the Will, by removing thoſe impediments, that ſtopt its motion. You know, if a wheel be ſcotcht, there is no ſtirring of it, until that be removed; even thus 'tis here. Sometimes the Will of man (which is the wheel of Motion) is ſcotcht, ſo that it cannot move forward, until that be remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved: Hence that of the Pſalmiſt, <hi>I will run the way of thy commandments, when thou ſhalt enlarge my heart,</hi> Pſal. 119.32. The word <hi>enlarge,</hi> doth not only ſignifie to widen, and extend a thing; but alſo, to ſet at liberty, and to free it from impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and incumbrances, and ſo it is uſed, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 4.1. <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> 
                     <hi>Thou haſt enlarged me, when I was in diſtreſs;</hi> or, <hi>Thou haſt ſet me at liberty.</hi> And as it is applicable to the outward ſtate and condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a man, ſo the Prophet makes uſe of the ſame word, in reference to tie the inward ſtate, <hi>I will run the wayes of thy commands.</hi> 
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>. <hi>when thou ſhalt ſet my heart at liberty. i. e.</hi> There is that in my heart, that cloggs me, and hinders me, that I cannot run the way of thy commands, until thou doſt remove it. Sometime the mind is clogg'd with ſtrong temptations. Sometimes with ſore preſſures of grief and horror. Sometimes with impetuous luſts and paſſions. And untill the Soul be ſet free, ſhe cannot move in the waies of God. And therefore divine relief comes into the Soul, in this caſe, to remove thoſe obſtructions, and to take away thoſe clogs. And many a gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Soul hath cauſe to ſay, Lord thou haſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:62437:64"/>my Heart. My Heart was ſcotcht, but thou haſt ſet me at liberty. I was peſterd with ſuch a temptation, and with ſuch a preſſure of grief and horrour, or with ſuch a paſſion and luſt: but thou haſt removed it, and ſet me at liberty. I know the perfect and full enlargement of the ſoul is not wrought, until ſhe comes in heaven; but God begins the work here: and oftentimes when ſhe is in the greateſt ſtreight, and ſo ſtopt in her motion, that ſhe is like an inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, quite out of tune, and ready to be hung up, or laid by, then God ſteps in, and affords this gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious relief to it.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Sometimes when God finds the ſoul in this dead and drowzie caſe, that it hath little mind or ſpirit unto duty, he makes uſe of the rod of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection; and then when the ſoul feels it ſmart, ſhe rouſeth up her ſelf, and ſets to work. Even as when <hi>Abſalon</hi> ſent for <hi>Joab</hi> to come to him once and again, and ſaw he would not ſtir, he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded his ſervants to ſet <hi>Joabs</hi> field on fire, and then <hi>Joab</hi> makes all the haſt he could to <hi>Abſalon,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 14.29 30.31. even thus it is here; God ſends for us, firſt one meſſenger comes and then another, to tell us, that God would have us come to him: As you have it, <hi>Cant.</hi> 2.14. <hi>Let me hear thy voice, let me ſee thy face.</hi> I, but we ſtir not, come not at God, either to pray to him, or praiſe him; that at laſt, God is forced to fire us out, and then we come. You have a notable place for this, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 5.15. <hi>I will go, and return to my place, till they acknowledge their offence, and ſeek my face: in their affliction, they will ſeek me early.</hi> They that lay ſnorting in their bed of ſecurity, in the time of
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:62437:64"/>proſperity, will be better husbands in time of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity; they'l get up early: the word ſignifies <hi>they ſhall morning me, i.e.</hi> they ſhall come in the morning of their time, and ſeek me. And ſo <hi>Eſay</hi> 26.16. <hi>They poured out a prayer unto thee when thy chaſtning was upon them, and in their affliction they viſited thee;</hi> Mark it, when the rod was upon their back, then they cry, and then they beg: I, they poured out a prayer. It was not (as one ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves upon the place) a dropping, now and then; but it was violent and continual: the ſpirit was ſtirred and now it cannot lie ſtill; Afflictions com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly move and ſtir the heart one way or other: ſometimes they ſtir the evil and croſs humours, that are in the heart of man, and then he rages and fumes againſt God, and his ways: but where grace is, there they ſtir up a lazy and a dull ſpirit to meet God in his way with mournings and ſupplications. The finger may be in the eye, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe grief is in the heart, but this ſorrow will have a vent, elſe the heart will not be at reſt: God and the ſoul muſt be friends, or ſhe can have no ſatisfaction. When God corrects the ſoul in good earneſt, then ſhe ſeeks him in good earneſt, and will not be quiet until ſhe finds him. So <hi>Eſay</hi> 26.8, 9. <hi>In the way of thy judgments, O Lord have we waited for thee: the deſire of our ſoul is to thy name, and to the remembrance of thee. With my ſoul, have I deſired thee in the night, with my ſpirit within me, will I ſeek thee early.</hi> Here is ſeeking indeed, the whole ſoul and ſpirit put forth, and that diligently and conſtantly, and then with wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing until ſhe find; <hi>We have waited for thee.</hi> 'Tis true affections do not always work thus in the
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:62437:65"/>heart of a good man at firſt. God whips and whips again, before the ſoul ſtirs; I, but God will not give over whipping, until ſhe ſtirs. Dull and heavy ſpirited Chriſtians ſeldom go long without a rod at their backs: and 'tis a great mercy when the rod of correction is any ways ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficacious to rouſe them up out of their drouzie and ſleepy ſtate.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. A third particular caſe of the failing of the natural faculties of the ſoul, is in point of reten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; the memory may fail. As a man may have a good head, and a naughty heart: ſo a man may have a good heart and a naughty head; a head that will hold little or nothing, that tends to the ſupport and comfort of his ſoul, when his fleſh fails him. A good Chriſtian may be like a leaking veſſel, that retains no liquor long; he may let ſlip the word of Gods grace, and the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal works of Gods grace, and not retain them long with him. I dare not queſtion the truth of that mans grace, that can't remember every truth he reads, or hears delivered; Nor may we ſay, that the work of Gods grace is not wrought in every one, that cannot at all times, call to mind. The great things that God hath done for him; the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> writing to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> tells them, <hi>That they had forgotten the exhortation, Heb.</hi> 12.5. Or <hi>you have forgotten the conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> as ſome render it; For the Greek <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> ſignifies both; becauſe conſolation oft-times flows in by a word of exhortation; and it intimates that they had forgotten, both the word of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, and the work of comfort. And thus it is with many a good Chriſtian; he comes to Church
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:62437:65"/>with great deſire to learn that which tends to the good of his ſoul, and he is reſolved to treaſure it up in his memory: I, but that is not faithful to him, but preſently looſeth that which he hath committed to its truſt. And it may be, God hath done great things for him, and given him great experience of his fatherly care over him, and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der love to him: I, but he hath loſt much of his experience; that it is to him, as if it had not been. Oftentimes when Chriſtians are under a cloud, they forget that the Sun of Gods favour ever ſhined upon them. And when they are in ſtreights forget the great Salvation that God hath wrought for them, when he called them out of a ſtate of ſin and miſery into a ſtate of grace and happineſs. And this is a great affliction to him, that he can't remember the works of the right hand of the Lord, nor the gracious, and ſoul ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſhing words of his mouth. Now is there no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief to be had from God in this caſe? Yes, and that I ſhall ſhew you in three particulars,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Sometimes God brings truths and experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences to our minds and remembrance, when we ſtand in the greateſt need of them. God deals with us as natural parents do with a dear child, whom they love exceedingly: it may be they beſtow a thing upon it, which is very uſeful for it, but for want of care, it looſeth it; the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents finding it, lay it up for the child againſt a time of need, and then bring it forth. Even thus doth God ſometimes; that truth and experience, which we have loſt, he treaſures up againſt a time of need, &amp; then brings it forth, when he knows it will do us the moſt good, Comfort ſhall be given
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:62437:66"/>in, when the ſoul hath quite forgotten, that ſhe ever had comfort. And as 'tis the office of the Holy Ghoſt to comfort mourners, ſo in order hereunto, he muſt teach the ſoul, and bring things to our remembrance. So it is promiſed, <hi>John</hi> 14.26. <hi>But the comforter, which is the Holy Ghoſt, whom the Father will ſend in my name, ſhall teach you all things, and bring all things to your remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance;</hi> Firſt, He muſt teach the ſoul thoſe things that belong to comfort: I, but the ſoul is very apt to forget what ſhe hath learned; Why if it doth ſo; then he is a remembrancer to bring things forgotten to our remembrance. As 'tis a notable comfort to a Chriſtian, in the time of trouble and ſorrow, to call the promiſes and providences of God to mind; ſo it is part of the Office of the Holy Ghoſt to bring things to our remembrance for our comfort. And ſometimes when things are quite out of our remembrance, and even buried in the grave of forgetfulneſs, the Holy Ghoſt brings them all to our minds as freſh as if we had but newly received them. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> wrote the ſame things to the <hi>Phillippians,</hi> which he had either preach'd to them or wrote to them before, that he might imprint them the better upon their minds: and ſome gather out of <hi>Matth.</hi> 5. compared with <hi>Luke</hi> 6.20. that our Saviour preached the ſame Sermon twice over; becauſe many hearers are dull to conceive, hard to believe, and apt to forget. And the Holy Ghoſt ſometimes comes and Preaches that again to the ſoul, which it may be ſhe heard ten or twenty years before, but had forgotten it. Perhaps thou art at a great loſs for a promiſe,
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:62437:66"/>and for former experiences, and wouldſt give any thing in the world for the comfort that once thou hadſt thereby: and then the Holy Ghoſt gives them in to thee. Dying Chriſtians ſometimes have had experience hereof, when all their comfort hath fled from them, as the brooks paſſed away from the troops of <hi>Tema.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. Sometimes when a Chriſtian hath forgotten old experiences, God creates new for his joy, and comfort. When old mercies are worn out of our remembrance, he engraves new mercies upon our minds; and when ſome promiſes of grace, and comfort are ſlipt out of our memory, he points us to others that are as ſuitable to our preſent ſtate. It may be thou haſt forgot the promiſes of this life, and God faſtens the promiſes of eternal life upon thy ſpirit; thou haſt forgot ſomething of that which thou haſt learnt heretofore. And to ſupply the want thereof, he teacheth thee ſomething which thou didſt never learn and ſometimes a word of precept is more needful to be taught, then the word of promiſe; and a Chriſtian finds it ſo. When the heart begins to grow wanton and looſe under gratious promiſes and experiences, it is juſt with God to take them away, and to feed her with harder Diet: yet ſo, that ſhe ſhall have cauſe to bleſs God at laſt for it; for elſe ſhe might have died of a ſurfeit. God doth not always adminiſter that to us, which is moſt toothſome, but that which is moſt wholſome; not always that which is moſt delightful, but that which is moſt need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, as is hinted by our Saviour, <hi>Matt.</hi> 6.8. <hi>Your father knoweth what you have need of, i. e.</hi> You may be ſure of that which God knows neceſſary and
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:62437:67"/>ſuitable to your preſent ſtate and condition; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he denies you that which you moſt deſire. A father doth not always provide the ſame diet for his children, but gives them ſometimes one thing and ſometimes another: but however, they ſhall have that which is moſt needful for them; and when he denies them that which their appetite longs for, and it can't be had, he gives them that which may be more for their health. Even thus God doth with his children: ſpiritual food they ſhall have; and although they muſt not always feed upon the ſame diſh, yet they ſhall have that which is beſt for them. New mercies are often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times given in to them, who have forgotten old. So that a Chriſtian hath a new ſong put into his mouth, to ſing before the Lord, as the Prophet ſaith, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 40.3. <hi>He hath put a new ſong into my mouth even praiſe unto our God.</hi> I confeſs it is the ſin and weakneſs of Chriſtians to forget old ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periences of Gods goodneſs to them; yet ſuch is the indulgence of our heavenly Father, as to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply our defects herein by a ſuitable diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, and to remember us, when we forget him.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Sometimes God ſupplies the want of a good memory, by a mighty and efficacious bleſſing of his Holy Spirit; ſo that there is much conveyed into the heart, to better that little that is retained in the head. A good work may be wrought upon the heart, when very few words, that are deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Preacher, are remembred. The word ſometimes paſſes through the ſoul, and leaves a ſweet ſavour behind it, although it ſtayeth not. It may be a poor ſoul goeth to hear a Sermon, and
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:62437:67"/>upon his return, would think he had loſt all his pains, were it not for this, that he hath felt the power and efficacy of the Spirit of God upon his heart to do him good; and for this he bleſſeth God. He finds his heart quickned, or melted, or eſtabliſhed in the faith; and this is better to him, than if he had it all by heart, without ſuch gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious effects. 'Tis good to remember what you hear; but 'tis better to be what you hear; when it may be ſaid of you, as our Saviour of his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, <hi>Now are ye clean through the word which I have ſpoken to you, John</hi> 15.3. As a ſieve will not hold the water, that is put into it, yet is waſhed and cleanſed by it; even thus it is with ſome hearers, though they can retain nothing of the expreſſion of the word, yet they are cleanſed by the lively and efficacious impreſſion thereof.</p>
                  <p>Beloved, I ſpeak not this to incourage any one in careleſs hearing and wilful neglect of retaining what they hear: but for the comfort of thoſe, who when they have given all diligence in their attention, yet their memory fails them in retain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what they have heard. And I deſire that all would take notice of this one thing; that though it be the duty of all, to treaſure up the word in their heads, yet the deſire of their ſouls ſhould be chiefly carried out after an impreſſion thereof up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their hearts. Head knowledge is good, but heart knowledge is better. To be able to repeat a Sermon is good, but to live a Sermon is better. And thou mayſt be ſure, that God will inable thee to live truth, in ſome meaſure, although thou art not able to expreſs the words thereof, as they are delivered to thee; And this ſhall be thy Relief in this caſe.</p>
                  <pb n="108" facs="tcp:62437:68"/>
                  <p>Thus much ſhall ſerve to ſhew you how Divine Relief flows in to the ſoul, when the natural fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties thereof fail.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Divine Relief flows in from God, to the Soul of a good man, when his infuſed habits fail; and in the opening of this, I muſt hold to my pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded method.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. I ſhall ſhew you, that they may fail, and how far they may fail.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. How relief flows into the Soul in this caſe. Firſt, The infuſed habits of Grace and Virtue may fail. There is not a Grace in a Chriſtian, but may fail at one time or other. Though the ſtate of Grace abideth alwaies; yet every mans grace, (if any mans) doth not alwaies abide in the ſame ſtate. A true frame of Grace, ſhall never be deſtroyed, but the heart of a gracious man doth not alwaies continue in the ſame frame. The ſtream may not be cut off, and yet there may be ebbings, as well as flowings. It may be low water with a Chriſtian at ſome time, in point of inherent grace, as well as ſpiritual comfort. He that hath the moſt grace, may ſeem like him, that hath the leaſt; and that in three things. 1. In reſpect of the ſtrength of Grace. 2. In reſpect of the vigour and acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity of Grace. 3. In reſpect of the beauty and luſtre of Grace.</p>
                  <p>Firſt in reſpect of the ſtrength of Grace: Grace is not alwaies in the ſame ſtrength. <hi>Abraham</hi> was ſtrong in Faith, yet his Faith was not alwaies alike. We find his Fear too ſtrong for his Faith: <hi>Abraham's</hi> Faith had ebbings and declinings. <hi>Job</hi>'s Patience at the firſt, was mighty to bear, and undergo his afflictions; yet at ſome time it flagg'd.</p>
                  <pb n="109" facs="tcp:62437:68"/>
                  <p>Secondly, Grace may fail in point of life and vigour: The ſpiritual life of a Chriſtian, may not be alwaies lively and active. Faith and love may not die, and yet they may ſtir very little; the fire of holy affections not be extinct, and yet not flame. The Church of <hi>Epheſus</hi> had left her firſt Love, but ſhe had not left off to love; ſhe loved Chriſt: I, but not as ſhe did at firſt; So it may be with others; there may be an abatement of their love, although not an extinguiſhment of it.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Grace may fail in reſpect of its beauty and lovelineſs; the beauty thereof may fade much. 'Tis with a Chriſtian, as 'tis with a fruit-bearing tree; the beauty of the tree, is its leaves and fruit: Now when the fruit is pluckt, and the leaves fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len, the beauty is gone. Even ſo the holy fruit of a Chriſtian, is the beauty of a Chriſtian; that which renders him and his grace very lovely in the eyes of good men: but when the fruit is off the tree, when you ſee not the fruit of holineſs and of ſpirituality growig upon him, in his ſeaſon, the beauty of a Chriſtian is departed from him. And thus it may be with a good man for a time. He that formerly acted very humbly, may upon ſome temptation, act very proudly. He that once acted very ſelf-denyingly, may at another time, act very ſelf-ſeekingly. He that formerly walked like a Saint, and truly acted the part of a Saint; may act not only below a Saint, but below a man: Such changes and varieties are found upon the moſt gratious frames of Spirit, which the beſt of Saints have in this world. The ſtrength of grace may ſo far abate, as that the ſtrength of ſin may increaſe. The vigour and life of grace
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:62437:69"/>may ſo far abate, as that little or nothing may appear, but the deformity of ſin.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, What relief flows into the heart of a good man in this caſe? God is ſtill the ſtrength of his heart,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. By preſerving the root and principle of grace alive that would die if it were not preſerved by a divine power. Every Chriſtian would ceaſe to be gracious, as well as fail in the exerciſe of grace, if he were wholly left to himſelf: I, but Chriſtians are kept in a ſtate of grace, by the power of God, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.5. <hi>Grace in a Chriſtian, is the root of a Chriſtian;</hi> and therefore Believers are ſaid to be rooted and grounded in love, <hi>Eph.</hi> 3.17. and as the root may live, when the fruit falls off, nay when the trunk of the tree withers and decays, that there is little life in it; ſo it may be with a Chriſtian. I, but how is this Root kept alive? Why, it is kept by an Almighty power. Though a Chriſtian doth not alwaies take care of his graces, that they may be liuely and ſtrong; yet God doth alwaies take care, that the root of grace may live; he will keep that alive. Divine power is like a ſtrong Fort or Garriſon to a Chriſtians Grace, that keeps it ſafe: It may be aſſaulted and beleaguered, but ſhall never receive a mortal wound. It is the great ſecurity of a Chriſtian, that God will not truſt him with the root and principle of grace. That ſhall never be in thine own keeping, he truſts thee with the exerciſe of grace, but not with the principle and root. No, he keeps that himſelf; he is both the Garriſon, and the Commander in it; and you may be ſure that that is impregnable.</p>
                  <pb n="111" facs="tcp:62437:69"/>
                  <p n="2">2. God is the ſtrength of a Chriſtians heart, when the infuſed habits of grace fail, and ſin grows ſtrong and vigorous; by healing and reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring him. A Chriſtian never fails in the exerciſe of grace, but ſin gives him a wound. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>David</hi> prayed, <hi>Lord heal my Soul, for I have ſinned,</hi> Pſal. 41.4. And what <hi>David</hi> prayed for, God promiſeth to his people, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 14.4. <hi>I will heal their back-ſlidings.</hi> The weakneſs and decay of grace, brings a Chriſtian preſently to the fall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſickneſs; and ſo it did <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Ephraim:</hi> I, but God will be a Phyſitian to the Soul in this caſe, and will heal their diſeaſes; and ſo he did <hi>Davids</hi> falling-ſickneſs: for which he return'd the tribute of Praiſe, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 103.3. <hi>My ſoul, praiſe thou the Lord, and all that is within me, praiſe his holy name, who healeth all thy diſeaſes. David</hi> had many diſeaſes upon him once; for one diſeaſe is the cauſe of another: I, but God healed all, and raiſed him up again. And herein the grace of God did ſhine forth with great luſtre and glory, that even raviſhed his ſoul in the ſenſe thereof. As it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears wonderful in preſerving ſpiritual life, and the root of grace, ſo it is no leſs to be admired for its healing and reſtoring virtue, that it puts forth upon the Soul, when ſpiritual diſeaſes have ceiſed upon it. You have a notable place for this, <hi>Cant.</hi> 8.5. <hi>I raiſed thee up under the apple-tree.</hi> They are the words of Chriſt to his Spouſe: She had been feeding her ſelf upon the forbidden fruit of earthly delights, and ſenſual pleaſures, until ſhe could ſtand upon her feet no longer, and there ſhe falls and lies: I, but then Chriſt comes to her ſeaſonably, takes her by the hand and raiſes her up.
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:62437:70"/>Green fruit will cauſe diſtempers in the body na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural; and ſenſual delights and pleaſures will cauſe diſeaſes in the body ſpiritual: none can cure them but Chriſt. When thou art fallen under the Apple-tree, he muſt raiſe thee up; nay, Chriſt will do it: though he may ſuffer the poor Soul to fall, yet he will not ſuffer it to lie and periſh. This is one main difference between the falls of a gracious man into ſin, and the fall of a wicked man. God lets a wicked man fall and lie in his ſin. As he falls willingly and reſolvedly, ſo he lies wretchedly, and deſperately in his ſin: But as a godly man falls through a weakneſs of grace, ſo God pities him, and raiſes him up again. <hi>Peter</hi> fell fouly, when he denied his Maſter, but he did not fall finally: Chriſt raiſed him up, and reſtored him to his former health and ſoundneſs. So you may ſee, <hi>Matth.</hi> 26.75. <hi>And Peter remembred the words of Jeſus, and he went out, and wept bitterly.</hi> The way that Chriſt takes to heal the backſlidings of his people, is to break their hearts and melt them into godly ſorrow. When poor Souls have been almoſt drown'd in the waies of ſin, he drowns their ſin in the red ſea of godly ſorrow; the Soul ſwims aloft, but his ſin ſinks to the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom, that it may riſe no more.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. God is the ſtrength of a Chriſtians heart, when grace fails, by working a new creation upon the heart. The giving of grace at firſt, is a creation; and hence new Converts, are called new creatures. So the ſtrengthening weak grace, and reviving and renewing of grace, is no leſs a creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; it is the work of an Almighty power upon the Soul. And therefore <hi>David</hi> prayed for it,
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:62437:70"/>under this notion; <hi>Create in me a clean heart, O God, and renew a right Spirit within me,</hi> Pſal. 50.10. God puts forth the ſame power in ſtrengthening the weakneſs of grace, as he doth in giving the firſt act of grace; as grace is not mans creature, but Gods. <hi>We are</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>Gods work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manſhip, created in Chriſt Jeſus, unto good works, Eph.</hi> 2.10. So the renewing and reviving grace, is not mans work, but Gods. When he ſeeth a poor Chriſtian lie languiſhing, that he is ſcarce able to put forth one act of grace he can neither believe, nor love, nor obey, that Satan makes a prey of him, and is ready to carry him away cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, as his priſoner, God creates new ſtrength, and a new life, and a new glory upon the Soul. If a Chriſtian hath his winter, he ſhall have his ſpring alſo; he ſhall not be alwaies without fruit. Moſt full is that promiſe, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 14.5, 6. <hi>I will be as the dew unto Iſrael: he ſhall grow as the lilly, and caſt forth his roots as Lebanon: His branches ſhall ſpread, and his beauty ſhall be as the olive tree, and his ſmell as Lebanon.</hi> Obſerve Gods method in working upon decaying Chriſtians. Firſt, he heals their backſlidings, ſo <hi>ver.</hi> 4. <hi>I will heal their backſlidings:</hi> I, but that is not all. For without divine influence the Soul will be as apt to relapſe as ever; and therefore God promiſeth, as a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther act of grace, that he will be as the dew unto <hi>Iſrael.</hi> Dew is of a fructifying and refreſhing nature, it calls forth the fruits of the earth, when they lie hid in the roots of trees, and herbs. Even ſo is Divine Influence, it is of a fructifying nature, and calls forth the fruits of grace, when they lie hid in the root thereof. Let but God ſend forth
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:62437:71"/>his power, and Grace will ſend forth new buds and bloſſoms of holineſs, that there ſhall be a new face upon a Chriſtian: He ſhall grow as the Lilliy, caſt forth his roots as Lebanon, his branches ſhall ſpread, and his beauty ſhall be as the Olive, and his ſmell as Lebanon.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. God is the ſtrength of a Chriſtians heart, by drawing forth much good out of this great evil. It is a ſore evil for a Chriſtian to decay in grace. and to fall into ſin: I, but God works good out of this evil.</p>
                  <p>Four things God works by this, and they are all good for him.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Hereby God diſcovers that corruption, that is in the heart. As when the water ebbs and grows low, then the earth appears; then you may ſee what is at the bottom: So when grace ebbs, and grows low, then the corruption of the heart ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears; then it is quickly known, what foul dregs are at the bottom. There is many a Chriſtian, that little thinks how full of ſin his heart is, until his grace grows languid and weak; and then he comes to have a ſad experience thereof. Thus it was with <hi>David;</hi> When grace became ſo weak in him, as not to be able to withſtand a tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, then he ſaw the uncleanneſs of his heart; and therefore cried to God, to waſh him and cleanſe him; and it is as if he had ſaid, Lord, I ſee now, what a filthy and unclean Spirit dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth in me: Lord, do thou purge it out, and cleanſe me from it. If any one had gone to <hi>David,</hi> and told him, that at ſuch a time, he ſhould be overcome by ſuch a temptation, and commit two great ſins: he would hardly have believed that his
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:62437:71"/>heart had been ſo bad. But after wards his expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience taught him.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Hereby God teacheth the Soul, where its ſtrength lieth; and on whom its grace depends. The decay of grace ſhews, that the ſtrength there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is not in man, nor in grace it ſelf; but like the Vine, it muſt have a ſupporter. Grace, can't live, nor thrive, without conſtant influences: I, but good men are too apt to depend upon their grace; and not to go to him for ſtrength in whom it lies. Now when a Chriſtian feels the decay of his grace, and his own inſufficiency to relieve and ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en it; this drives him out of himſelf to Chriſt. This is one main difference between the total want of grace, and a ſenſe of decay in grace. The total want of grace drives men from Chriſt; but a ſenſe of the decay of grace, drives men to Chriſt. So it did <hi>David,</hi> his weakneſs brought him upon his knees.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The falls of Chriſtians, through the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of grace, and the power of ſin, are made no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table antidotes and preſervatives againſt final Apoſtaſie. For as there is nothing that eſtrangeth the heart from God, as ſpiritual pride and ſelf-confidence; ſo nothing keeps the heart ſo cloſe to God, as a filial fear of offending God. So you may ſee, <hi>Jer.</hi> 32.40. <hi>And I will make an everlaſting covenant with them, that I will not turn away from them to do them good, but I will put my fear in their hearts, that they ſhall not depart from me.</hi> This is that which hemms in the Soul, that it cannot go aſtray. Now the falls of Chriſtians provoke and draw forth this filial fear into act The burnt child dreads the fire; and he that hath been ſtung
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:62437:72"/>with a Serpent, will ſhun his hole; ſo it is here. None ſo fearful of falling into ſin, as they that have fallen. None ſo wary and watchful; none ſo reſolute and ſtout againſt temptations, and occaſions of ſin, as thoſe who have been at a time overcome.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Theſe falls and decayes, are like mighty winds to the Oak, that ſettles him faſter, and make him root deeper in Chriſt. As the more the Oak is ſhaken (if it falls not) the faſter and deeper it is rooted in the earth: So when a Chriſtian hath been ſhaken with the winds of temptations and corruptions, the faſter hold he layeth upon Chriſt, and the deeper he is rooted in him. For,
<list>
                        <item>1. His experience of Chriſt's faithfulneſs in keeping him from falling finally and totally, ſtrengthens his faith in Chriſt.</item>
                        <item>2. His experience of Chriſt's pardoning love, knits and unites his heart cloſe to Chriſt.</item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>Firſt, His experience of Chriſt's faithfulneſs, in keeping him from falling totally and finally, ſtrengthens his faith in Chriſt. As 'tis a notable trial of Chriſt's faithfulneſs, to keep Saints from falling away finally, when they fall ſouly: ſo experience of Chriſt's faithfulneſs is a notable ſtrengthener of a Chriſtians faith in Chriſt. <hi>They that know thy name, will put their truſt in thee,</hi> ſaith <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 9.10. A friend that keeps cloſe to a man in time of need, may well be truſted. Even ſo 'tis here. Chriſt keeps cloſe to a Chriſtian, even at that time, when he deſerves to be caſt off, and is both a ſhame and a grief to Chriſt. Surely the experience hereof, muſt needs be a great incouragement to a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:62437:72"/>to truſt him for ever. He ſeeth that Chriſts ſtrength never fails, although his own ſtrength fail. He ſeeth that there is grace enough in Chriſt to ſupport him in the weakeſt condition, and to raiſe him up, when he is at the loweſt. Nay fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, he finds this ſtrength put forth upon him, according to the word of promiſe; and though he is unbelieving, yet Chriſt abides faithful to him; And therefore he cannot but conclude from hence, that Chriſt will be his ſtrength for ever, and will never fail him.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, A Chriſtians experience of the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and continuance of Chriſts pardoning love, knits and unites his ſoul faſter to Chriſt, then ever; this doth endear Chriſt to the ſoul ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly; tryed love is an endearing love; and if any thing will draw out the ſouls affections un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Chriſt, and confirm them againſt all future aſſaults, it is the renewing of pardons, upon the renewal of offences. When the ſoul ſhall hear Chriſt ſay as he doth, <hi>Eſay</hi> 43.24, 25. <hi>Thou haſt brought me no ſweet cane with money, neither haſt thou filled me with the fat of thy ſacrifices, but thou haſt made me to ſerve with thy ſins; thou haſt wearied me with thine iniquities. I am he that blotteth out thy tranſgreſſion for mine own ſake and will remember thy ſins no more;</hi> I ſay when the ſoul ſhall hear this, it muſt needs be deeply affected herewith. What! Will the Lord be gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious to ſuch a vile wretch as I am? Will he par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don a backſlider? Will he forgive the ſin of one that hath made him to ſerve with his ſin, and wearied him with iniquities? O here is wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful love; this is tranſcendent love! and ſhall not I
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:62437:73"/>love him, that hath loved me thus? Yet Lord, thou knoweſt, that I love thee; 'tis true, I have backſlidden, and grievouſly offended; but I will do ſo no more. Thus God ſometimes, doth the ſoul much good by that which in it ſelf doth him the greateſt hurt: as, pain eaſeth a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, death revives him, diſſolution unites him, ſo corruption clarifies him; and this is a moſt gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious relief.</p>
                  <p>But before I leave this particular I muſt enter four cautions.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That no man take up the better opinion of ſin hereby; for as darkneſs is nevertheleſs an evil, though God bring light out of darkneſs; ſo ſin is nevertheleſs an evil, though God is pleaſed to bring good out of it. Poiſon is deſtructive, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though a Phyſician can ſo correct it, as to make it medicinal, and ſo is ſin; and the better opinion thou haſt of ſin, the more evil and mortal it will be to thee.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Take heed of lying in ſin, with hopes of a relief from God: watch againſt it, pray againſt it, that thou mayeſt not be overcome of it: but however if thou art overcome by a temptation, if Satan hath tript up thy heels, get upon thy feet again, aſſoon as poſſibly thou canſt; if thou fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt with <hi>Peter,</hi> weep with <hi>Peter,</hi> and labour to find as much bitterneſs in ſin, as thou haſt found of a ſeeming pleaſure in it. Remember this, that more have fallen into ſin with hopes of ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing again, then have riſen after they have fallen. Many ſin with <hi>Peter,</hi> but few repent with him.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Labour to prevent decays in grace: It is
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:62437:73"/>eaſier to keep health, then to recover it; And it is eaſier to maintain grace in ſtrength and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour, then to recover any degree of grace, when 'tis loſt. Though it be Gods goodneſs to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore grace, yet it is your duty to prevent the loſs thereof.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Watch the firſt decay of grace, leaſt it grow to a total conſumption of all, obſerve the leaſt flagging of faith and love, when it comes to a trial; a little grace may ſerve to repair a little decay: but thou wilt ſtand in need of much to repair a great decay; and therefore as ſoon as grace be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins to fail, do thou begin to repair. O, ply the throne of grace for ſtrengthening influences, leaſt thy weakneſs prove dangerous and deſperate: however, do not abuſe relieving grace by a preſent ſecurity.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The third particular failing of the heart is the failing of Animal ſpirits, that the man is rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to fall into a ſwoon, or the ſoul juſt taking its flight from the body, and leaving its old ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitation. So the Church complains, <hi>Cant.</hi> 5.6. <hi>My ſoul failed; Arias Montanus</hi> renders it, <hi>My ſoul went forth;</hi> And this made <hi>David</hi> cry out; <hi>Hear me ſpeedily, O Lord, my ſpirit faileth; I am like them that go down into the pit. David</hi> was a man ful of ſpirit, and yet he was at this time, as if he had had no ſpirit; As 'tis ſaid of <hi>Nabal, his heart died within him, and became as a ſtone,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 25.87. And thus it may be with a good man at ſome time, and that in theſe caſes,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. When hope is deſerr'd and expectation diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointed; <hi>Hope deferr'd</hi> (ſaith <hi>Solomon</hi>) <hi>makes the beart ſick, Prov.</hi> 13.12. <hi>i. e.</hi> When the thing
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:62437:74"/>hoped for is deferr'd: a mans heart is ſet upon a thing, and he hopes for the obtaining it, and he waits, and waits, and yet it comes not, this makes the heart ſick; but if his expectation be diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, then his ſpirit dies. It often falls out, that mans time, and Gods time are not the ſame; Man ſets a time to himſelf, and thinks thus; at ſuch a time ſuch a mercy and ſuch a good will come in: I, but Gods time may be long after. Now when he ſeeth that ſtill he muſt wait, and yet the mercy comes not, his heart fails, his ſpirit ſinks.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. When God hides his face from the ſoul, and ſhe can't ſee it; This was <hi>Davids</hi> caſe, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 143.7. <hi>My ſpirit faileth, hide not thy face from me, leaſt I be like unto them that go down into the pit, i. e.</hi> The hiding of thy face will quite kill my ſpirits. As the light of Gods countenance is the life of the ſoul; ſo the hiding of Gods countenance is its death: No ſooner doth God depart from a good man, but his ſoul is ready to depart; So it was with the Church, <hi>Cant.</hi> 5.6. <hi>I opened to my be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved, but my beloved had withdrawn himſelf, and was gone: my ſoul failed, when he ſpake. I ſought him, but I could not find him: I called him, but he gave me no anſwer.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. When the ſoul is wounded with the ſenſe of ſin, and of Gods diſpleaſure for ſin; the burden and pain is intolerable, and then the ſpirit ſinks. As nothing ſinks the ſpirit ſo much as ſorrow and grief: So no grief is ſo heavy upon the ſoul as grief for ſin, and the ſenſe of Gods wrath. You have a notable paſſage for this, <hi>Job</hi> 6.4. <hi>For the arrows of the Almighty are within me, the poiſon whereof
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:62437:74"/>drink up my ſpirits.</hi> An arrow is a deadly Engine, ſo called in <hi>Hebrew,</hi> from its effect, cutting or wounding; and God ſometimes ſhoots an arrow which pierceth into the ſoul, cuts and wounds it, yea, ſometimes he ſhoots a poiſoned dart, and that drinks up the ſpirit, <hi>i. e.</hi> it kills the ſpirit. Even as a great fire drinks up a little water, that is thrown upon it; So Gods wrath drinks up the ſpirit; it leaves no ſpirit in the heart of a man.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. A ſudden paſſion of fear makes the heart to fail. So <hi>Luke</hi> 21.26. Mens hearts failing them for fear; Fear when it is exceſſive, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpirits a man. <hi>When</hi> Joſephs <hi>brethren found their money in their ſacks,</hi> it is ſaid, <hi>their hearts failed them;</hi> and why? <hi>for they were afraid,</hi> Gen. 42.28.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Some ſtrong temptation of Satan may make the heart to fail, eſpecially if grace be weak. Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans aſſaults ſometimes are very violent; they come upon the heart with great power, like a mighty torrent, that overwhelms and ſinks the ſpirit. Thus <hi>Luther</hi> was aſſaulted by him; His temptation was ſo ſtrong, that it ſeemed to him, as if the ſwelling ſurges of the Sea did ſound aloud at his left ear, and that ſo violently, that die he muſt, except they preſently grew calm: afterwards when the noiſe came within his head, he fell down as one dead, and was ſo cold in each part, that he had remaining neither heat, nor blood, nor ſenſe, nor voice; and thus it hath been with others. The temptations of Satan are ſometimes ſo ſtrong, and violent upon the ſoul, as to cauſe the Animal Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits to fail.</p>
                  <pb n="122" facs="tcp:62437:75"/>
                  <p>Theſe are the particular caſes wherein God reveals and makes known the greatneſs of his ſtrength for the relief of his people.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. When a mans heart fails him through a diſappointment; then there is a relief for him,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. By exchanging a mercy; the ſoul hopes for one, and God gives in a better and more deſire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able. God deals not with his people, as <hi>Laban</hi> dealt with <hi>Jacob;</hi> inſtead of a fair and beautiful <hi>Rachel,</hi> he put him off with a blear eyed <hi>Leah.</hi> No! God doth the contrary, it may be thou art ſet upon a blear-eyed <hi>Leah,</hi> and God gives thee a fair <hi>Rachel;</hi> My meaning is, when the heart of a Chriſtian is ſet upon, and ſtrongly carried out after a low and inferiour mercy, and the ſoul is ſick for want of it even ready to die, God gives him an higher, and more glorious mercy. As God is often better to us then our deſires, ſo he is better to us then our hopes, and when he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appoints our hopes, he gives us a mercy that is beyond our hopes; For God is no way tyed to the hopes of his people; but onely to his word of promiſe; and that he will perform in his own way and time. Now ſometimes the hope of a Chriſtian may be falſely bottom'd, and not rightly fixt on Gods word, and then it is no wonder if we meet with a diſappointment; I, but though God doth fruſtrate our expectation, he will not break his word. The promiſe of God doth not fail; although we are apt to think it doth, when our hope and expectation is diſappointed. The word of the Lord ſtandeth ſure; even then when we are not ſure, that the thing we deſire and
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:62437:75"/>hope for ſhall be granted to us: and hence it comes, that inſtead of the mercy we deſire, God gives us in that, which he hath promiſed, although not deſired nor hoped for.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. God relieves the hearts of his people by gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving in the deſired mercy, when they are paſt all hope of it. When the ſoul is at the very brink of deſpair, then the mercy is given in to revive it; and that is implied in thoſe words of <hi>Solomon, Prov.</hi> 13.12. <hi>Hope deferred maketh the heart ſick, but when the deſire cometh it is a tree of life, i. e.</hi> God may defer the mercy ſo long as to make the heart ſick, even unto death, and then beſtow i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ſoul: now when it cometh it is a tree of life; an alluſion to that tree, that God planted in Paradiſe, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.9. A tree that was a ſymbole or ſign of life; as the Sacraments are of grace. Now as the faith, hope, and comfort of a true Chriſtian is fed, nouriſhed, and revived by theſe external ſymbols &amp; ſigns: ſo it is revived by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of a deſired mercy. When the ſoul hath been languiſhing at the door of hope, until it grows out of hope, and is ready to periſh, then God throws in the mercy to revive and comfort it. Nay further.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. God ſometimes gives in the mercy, in a way that is beyond all hope; in a way that ſeems the moſt croſs to the hopes of a Chriſtian. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times God ſhuts up all the doors of hope; and makes that to be the way of conveying mercy to us. So God promiſed to his people of old, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 2.15. <hi>The valley of Achor for a door of hope,</hi> i. e. when they ſhould be deſtitute of thoſe means, as might encourage them to hope, and meet with the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:62437:76"/>difficulties and troubles, that they could meet with, then the deſired mercy ſhould be given. Great croſſes oftentimes make way for, and uſher in great mercies. Now when mercy comes in unexpectedly, and in a croſs way, it comes with the greater force and power upon the Soul, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vive and comfort it. Mercies that are common to the Soul, do not make ſuch a ſtrong impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion upon it, as thoſe that are either more ſpecial, or come to the Soul in a ſingular and unexpected way. Such mercies are very ſweet and precious to the Soul.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. As there is relief for a good man in this caſe, ſo when the heart fails, through the hiding of Gods face. And that I ſhall ſhew you briefly in three things,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. When a good man cannot ſee Gods face, God ſpeaks to him, and gives him ſtrength to ſeek his face. When the Soul can't hear God, yet ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſhe hears the voice of God. So it was with <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 27.8, 6. <hi>When thou ſaidſt, Seek my face; my heart ſaid unto thee, Thy face, Lord, will I ſeeek. Hide not thy face from me, put not thy ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant away in anger.</hi> God hid his face from <hi>David,</hi> I, but he did not ſhut up his lips; <hi>David</hi> had the happineſs to hear his voice, though it was but from behind a curtain: And this encouraged, and drew forth his Soul to ſeek Gods face. So when Chriſt withdrew himſelf from his Spouſe, that ſhe knew not what was become of him, ſhe ſought him, but could not find him; I, but ſhe heard his voice, <hi>Cant.</hi> 5.6. And it is a great comfort to a good man, to hear the voice of God, when he cannot ſee the face of God. Sometimes God
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:62437:76"/>ſpeaks to the Soul by his word, and ſometimes by his works; and thereby draws it forth to ſeek his face. This is a notable ſign; that God is not wholly and eternally departed from us. When God leaves a wicked man, he doth not ſo much as ſpeak to him, he ſhall not hear from God, unleſs it be by way of denouncing judgement againſt him. But when he withdraws, and hides his face from a good man, he ſhall hear the voice of God, though he cannot ſee his well pleaſed face. God is deſirous to ſee their face, although he hides his own; and therefore calls to them, to come and ſeek his face. <hi>Thou ſaidſt, Seek my face,</hi> and this voice of God, cauſed an eccho in <hi>David</hi>'s Soul; <hi>And I ſaid, Thy face, Lord, will I ſeek.</hi> And this is one end of God in hiding his face from the Soul, that hereby he may draw forth the deſires of it after him. As a mother ſometimes turns her back upon the child, to ſee wehther it will cry after her: Even thus doth God; and it is wonderful delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to him, to hear a Soul cry after him, when he hath withdrawn himſelf and his face from it.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Sometimes, when a good man can't ſee the well-pleaſed face of God, he feels the hand of God, not the weight thereof to cruſh him down, but the power and ſtrength thereof to ſuſtain, and uphold him. That which the Church had experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of in another caſe, when ſhe was ſick of love, <hi>Cant.</hi> 2.6. ſhe did promiſe to her ſelf in this caſe, <hi>Cant.</hi> 8.3. <hi>His left hand ſhould be under her head, and his right hand ſhould embrace her.</hi> Chriſt puts forth both hands; one for the head, and another for the heart; to keep the ſoul from death in this caſe.</p>
                  <pb n="126" facs="tcp:62437:77"/>
                  <p n="1">1. The left hand of Chriſt is put under the head, to keep up and maintain a good opinion of him. When the ſoul is full of inward trouble it is full of thoughts; So <hi>Pſal.</hi> 94.19. <hi>In the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of my thoughts within me.</hi> Nay it is apt to have hard thoughts of God; ſuch as are unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming the dear children of ſo gratious a father; We are apt to think, that when God hides his face from us, he hath forgotten to be gratious, and in anger ſhut up his tender mercies from us; that his mercy is clean for ever, and that his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe fails for evermore; that the Lord hath caſt us off for ever, and will be favourable no more. To theſe and the like thoughts is a troubled ſoul very prone, when God withdraws; Now Chriſt to prevent theſe, or to moderate them, puts his hand under our head. As the putting of ones hand under the head of a ſick perſon is a great ſtay to it, and affords it ſome eaſe, that he may com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to reſt; ſo doth Chriſt deal with a ſoul, that is ſick and ready to die, in the ſenſe of Gods hiding his face from it. He puts under his hand to keep the judgement right, that it may main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain a good opinion of God, and keep up good thoughts of him, and this is a great eaſe to a good man; for there is nothing afflicts the ſoul more, then ſuch hard thoughts of God; they are a great torture and perplexity to the ſoul, and when they are removed, the mind finds great refreſhment thereby.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The right hand of Chriſt is put forth to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace the ſoul; As his left hand is under the head, ſo his right hand doth embrace a good man; and with this he ſtays the heart and keeps it from dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:62437:77"/>when the ſoul is going forth he ſtays it and keeps it in. So ſaith <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 18.18. <hi>But the Lord was my ſtay.</hi> The right hand of Divine Grace and ſtrength doth compaſs the ſoul about, and thereby keeps it from going forth: and that is promiſed, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 32.10. <hi>Mercy ſhall compaſs him about.</hi> The mercy of God is a long arm, and this doth incircle the ſoul and compaſs it about; the ſoul can ſtir no way but mercy meets it, to ſtay its flight. Sometime God ſends a friend to him, who out of his own experience drops a ſeaſonable word of comfort upon his ſoul, and that is a mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy. <hi>Job</hi> 33.23. Sometime God applies a word of Grace that enlivens his dead heart, and that is a mercy. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.50. Sometimes God brings to mind ſome former intimations of his love, and grace to him, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 42.6. And ſometime and very often he ſtays the ſoul with this very thought; that it is a great mercy of God to him, that yet he is on this ſide hell,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Lam.</hi> 3.22.</note> and though he can't ſee the face of God, yet he is not put ſo far off, but he may have the happineſs to ſee it at the laſt. 'Tis mercy, that he is not eternally baniſhed from his preſence; And this ſtays the heart.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Though God hides his face for a time, yet he doth at one time or other unvail and diſcover it to the ſoul, for its unſpeakable joy and comfort. If not in this life, yet in the life to come, a true Chriſtian ſhall ſee the face of God again, although it be hid for a time. You have an excellent pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe for this, <hi>Eſay</hi> 54.7, 8. <hi>For a ſmall moment have I forſaken thee, but with great mercies will I gather thee: in a little wrath I hid my face from
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:62437:78"/>thee, for a moment; but with everlaſting kindneſs will I have mercy on thee, ſaith the Lord thy redeemer.</hi> Gods departure from a good man is not an eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal departure; His hiding his face, is not for ever: Though thou canſt not ſee it now, yet thou ſhalt ſee it; Thou mayſt ſay with <hi>David, Why art thou caſt down, O my ſoul, and why art thou ſo diſquieted within me? hope thou in God, for I ſhall yet praiſe him for the help of his countenance, Pſal.</hi> 42.5.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. In caſe that the Animal Spirits do fail a man, through the ſenſe of ſin and Gods diſpleaſure for it, there is relief to be had from God: when the poiſoned arrows of Divine wrath ſtick faſt in the ſoul, and drinks up the Spirits, there is relief for it; And this I ſhall alſo make evident to you in three things.</p>
                  <p>There are three remedies that God makes uſe of to cure the wounds that ſin and Gods wrath make in the Soul. 1. The blood of Sprinkling. 2. The precious Balm of Goſpel promiſes. 3. The ſweet oyl of the Holy Spirit.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The blood of ſprinkling, or the blood of Chriſt ſprinkled upon the heart: this waſheth and cleanſeth the wound; So 1 <hi>John</hi> 1.7. <hi>And the blood of Chriſt cleanſeth us from all ſin;</hi> And ſo <hi>Revel.</hi> 5. <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto him that loved us, and waſhed us from our ſins in his own blood:</hi> For as a wound in the body natural will not heal, unleſs the blood and corruption be waſhed out, no more will the wounds of the ſoul ever be cured, unleſs they be firſt waſhed with the blood of Chriſt. And therefore this is Gods firſt work to apply the blood of Chriſt to the wound; and it is very effectual for
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:62437:78"/>this purpoſe; as you may ſee, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.13, 14. <hi>For if the blood of bulls and of goats<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the aſhes of an heifer, ſprinkling the unclean, ſanctifieth to the purifying of the fleſh: How much more ſhall the blood of Chriſt purge your conſcience?</hi> It firſt ſtancheth the blood, and then purifies the wound, and makes it fit for a plaiſter; The meaning hereof is this, that the knowledge of our juſtification by the righteouſneſs of Chriſt is a ſingular and choice remedy, for the taking away the ſenſe of ſin and Gods diſpleaſure for it; It is not only requiſite that Chriſt ſhed his blood for us, and that God hath accepted it as a full ſatisfaction to His Divine Juſtice which was offended by our ſin, but this muſt be applyed to us. As under the Law, it was not enough, to have the blood of bulls and of goats, but it muſt be ſprinkled, or elſe there was no cleanſing; even ſo, unleſs God applies the blood of Chriſt to thy conſcience, and give thee the knowledge thereof, that it is ſhed for thee in particular, thy Spiritual wounds that ſin and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan hath made in thee, will never be cleanſed; Thou mayeſt be juſtified before God, but ſtill thine own heart may accuſe and condemn thee; Though God doth not charge thy ſin upon thee, yet thou wilt be continually charging it upon thy ſelf; and the burden will be intolerable; thy wounds will ſtill bleed; every remembrance of ſin, will draw new blood from thy heart; It is true the bleſſing lies in Gods free remiſſion of our ſin; but the comfort lies in our knowledge thereof. A traitour may be pardoned, and that may ſave his life, but if he knows it not, he looſeth the comfort thereof. Even thus it is, until we know that God hath
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:62437:79"/>freely juſtified us in the blood of Chriſt, the ſenſe of ſin, and Divine wrath will be heavy upon the ſpirit of an awakened ſinner, and therefore God's ſprinkling the blood of Chriſt upon the conſcience muſt needs be a ſweet relief.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Another remedy which God makes uſe of for the curing of this ſpiritual wound, is the balm of Goſpel promiſes: there are two ſorts of promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, by which God ſpeaks comfort to a diſconſolate ſoul. 1. Inviting promiſes. 2. Aſſuring and ſealing promiſes.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Inviting promiſes and by theſe he encourages a poor diſtreſſed ſinner to come to him; Such is that, <hi>Matth.</hi> 11.28. <hi>Come unto me all ye that are weary and heavy laden;</hi> And that <hi>Eſay</hi> 55.1. <hi>Ho, every one that thirſteth, come ye to the waters: he that hath no money; come ye buy and eat, yea come buy wine and milk without money and without price;</hi> And that <hi>Rev.</hi> 22.17. <hi>And the Spirit and the Bride ſay, come, and let him that heareth, ſay, come, and let him that is a thirſt come; and whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever will, let him take the water of life freely.</hi> Now when a ſoul that heareth theſe promiſes, conſiders with it ſelf thus; Sure I am, that I am weary and heavy laden with the burden of ſin; ſin is an hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy load upon my ſoul; the arrows of Gods in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation have ſet my ſoul on fire, that I ſtand in need of theſe cooling and refreſhing waters; I am a poor ceature; I have no money; nothing to give for the incomes of Gods grace and love; I am a meer beggar; and therefore muſt needs be one that God invites. And thus God draws the ſoul to him, that he may apply,</p>
                  <pb n="131" facs="tcp:62437:79"/>
                  <p n="2">2. The aſſuring and ſealing promiſes of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort: Such as theſe, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.16, 17. <hi>This is the Covenant that I will make with them after thoſe days, ſaith the Lord, I will put my laws into their hearts, and in their minds will I write them, and their ſins and iniquities will I remember no more;</hi> And that in <hi>Eſay</hi> 57.15, 16, 17, 18, 19. <hi>For thus ſaith the high and lofty one, that inhabiteth eternity, whoſe name is holy. I will dwell in the high, and holy place: with him alſo that is of a contrite and humble ſpirit, to revive the ſpirit of the humble, and to revive the heart of the contrite ones. For I will not contend for ever neither will I be always wroth: for the ſpirit ſhould fail before me, and the ſouls that I have made. For the iniquity of his covetouſneſs was I wroth and ſmote him: I hid me and was wroth, and he went on frowardly in the way of his heart; I have ſeen his ways and will heal him; I will lead him, and reſtore comfort unto him. I create the fruit of the lips, peace, peace to him that is far off, and to him that is near, ſaith the Lord, and I will heal him.</hi> Now as theſe promiſes are the matter of comfort, ſo they are the means of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort; For when God applies them to a wounded ſoul, there paſſeth a vertue and power through them to heal and cure it.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. To this he adds the oyl of his Holy Spirit, and that he drops into the wound; and this doth not only heal, but takes away the very ſcar of the wound, and renders the skin as freſh and beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful as before; Oyl in Scripture ſets out joy and chearfulneſs, and therefore it is called the oyl of joy; And <hi>Eſay</hi> 61.3. <hi>To appoint unto them, that mourn in Sion, to give unto them beauty for
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:62437:80"/>aſhes, and the oyl of joy for mourning;</hi> This cures the mournful ſad and perplexed ſpirit, and makes the face to ſhine again with brightneſs and glory; according to that, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 104.15. <hi>And oyl to make the face to ſhine.</hi> I do not ſay, that God always raiſeth the comfort of the ſoul thus high, but ſometimes he doth, not only heal, but anoint and make the ſoul fair and lovely in his eye; For there is no ſuch ſight in Gods eye, as a ſanctified heart that is chearful and joyful before him; ſuch a ſoul is the joy and delight of his heart; and eſpecially where he hath made the deepeſt wound, and filled the ſoul with the greateſt horrour in the ſenſe of his wrath and diſpleaſure, there when he comes to give peace and comfort, he anoints the moſt; the greater wound the greater meaſure of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort; and hence it is, that many a ſoul bleſſeth God for its wounds, becauſe elſe it would never have attained to ſuch joys and comforts as God gives in. Thus I have ſhewn you what relief flows into the ſoul in this caſe.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. In caſe that the Animal Spirits fail through a ſudden paſſion of fear; There is relief for it, And that four ways.</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>1. Sometimes God preventeth the thing feared, and never ſuffers it to come to paſs.</item>
                     <item>2. Sometimes God delivers the ſoul from its fears.</item>
                     <item>3. Sometimes the thing feared is ſo ordered and diſpoſed by the Lord, that it is leſs then our fear, not worth our fear.</item>
                     <pb n="133" facs="tcp:62437:80"/>
                     <item>4. Sometimes God turns the fears of his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants into the right channel, that inſtead of fearing evil, they fear him more then ever they did.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p>Firſt, Sometime God prevents the thing feared, and never ſuffers it to come to paſs; or at leaſt not at that time we are afraid it will: 'tis true <hi>Job</hi> could ſay, <hi>the thing which I feared is come upon me, Job</hi> 3.25. <hi>I was not in ſafety, neither had I reſt, nor was I quiet, yet trouble came.</hi> I, but many a good man hath cauſe to ſay, the thing which I greatly feared is not come upon me; Though God did not deliver me from my diſtruſtful fear, yet he deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me from that which I did fear. As ſometimes we groundleſly expect and hope for a thing that never comes: ſo ſometimes we groundleſly fear an evil that never comes. As God denyes the deſires of a groundleſs confidence in great mercy, ſo he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents our groundleſs fears in mercy; For as wicked men are apt to fear evil leſs then they ſhould, ſo the godly are apt to fear evil more then they ſhould. But as that which wicked men fear not, comes ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly upon them, ſo ſometimes that which a godly man fears, comes not at all; This made <hi>David</hi> ſay, <hi>Pſa.</hi> 34.4. <hi>I ſought the Lord and he heard me, and delivered me from all my fears, i. e.</hi> He deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered me from the evils which I feared; The effect is here put for the cauſe.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Sometimes the Lord delivers a good man from the fear of evil. I mean, from a diſtruſtful, diſtracting, and tormenting fear, which diſpirits him, and ſinks his ſpirits; As ſome fear, where no fear is, ſo ſometimes God animates, and lifts up the ſoul above fear, where fear is; True faith will ſtrive with tormenting fears,
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:62437:81"/>and when 'tis made ſtrong, will caſt them out. There is an excellent promiſe for this, <hi>Job.</hi> 11.14.15. <hi>If iniquity be in thine hand put it far away, and let not wickedneſs dwell in thy tabernacle. For then thou ſhalt lift up thy face without ſpot, yea thou ſhalt be ſtedfaſt, and ſhalt not fear.</hi> Noting out, that when faith is ſo ſtrong as to purifie the heart and life from ſin, then it ſets the Soul free from the fear of thoſe evils, that come by ſin. Now this is a great relief to the Soul. For to be freed from the fear of evil, is better then to be freed from the evil. The promiſe runs not thus, Thou ſhalt be freed from evil, but thou ſhalt be freed from the fear of evil. Happineſs conſiſts more in removing inward, then outward trouble. He that is afraid of evil, before it comes, may be happy though it comes.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, The thing feared, is ſo ordered and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed by the Lord; that it is a leſſer evil, then we feared, and is not worth our fear. Many are far more afraid then hurt; or more hurt by their fears, then by the evils they feared. We are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed very apt to greater evils, and leſſer mercies; and that is the reaſon, that we meet with evils with ſo much fear, and mercies with ſo little faith. The thoughts of one evil torments our Spirits more, then the thoughts of many mercies cheers and comforts our Spirits. I, but Gods thoughts are above our thoughts; and when we are afraid, that the evil impending will be very great, it proves very little. 'Tis with many Chriſtians, as with ſome inexperienced Patients; they dread the taking of any Phyſick, leſt it ſhould overpower nature:
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:62437:81"/>but when they come to take it, they find it works not half ſo much, as they feared it would. A wiſe Phyſitian tempers the potion, according to the conſtitution of the body, and the nature of the diſtemper, and not according to the fears of the Patient. Even thus doth God oftentimes deal with us; he orders and corrects all our evils, ſo that they prove leſs hurtful, and more beneficial to us, then we could think; not one dram too much, or too little. He proportions not our purging Phyſick according to our fancies, but to our neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity; when a little will ſerve the turn, he will not exceed.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Sometimes God turns the fears of his ſervants into the right channel; that in ſtead of fearing evil, they fear him more then before they did; and the fear of God is a notable means to cure the fear of evils. (As one ſaith well) He fears nothing elſe, who fears that one thing, to ſin; and he fears none elſe, who fears that one, who is more then all, God. The fear of God is an excellent antidote againſt the power and poyſon of all other fears. You have a full place for this, <hi>Eſ.</hi> 8.13, 14. <hi>Fear not their fear, nor be afraid; ſanctifie the Lord of Hoſts himſelf, and let him be your fear, and let him be your dread.</hi> He that would not fear that which the wicked ſometimes do, and ought to fear, muſt fear him only whom they do not fear. And this is Gods great work, to put his fear into the hearts of his people, and that will caſt out all diſtruſtful and diſtracting fears.</p>
                  <p>Thus I have diſpatcht the fourth caſe.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly and laſtly, In caſe that the Animal Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits fail through ſome ſtrong temptation of Satan;
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:62437:82"/>there is relief for it. As Satan ſets all his power and policy on work againſt the Soul: So God ſets all his power and wiſdom on work, to relieve and help it. And when Satan doth his worſt to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy it, God doth his beſt to ſave it. Relieving power comes in according to invading power: when All might is againſt him, then all might is for him. Three things God doth for an aſſaulted Chriſtian. 1. He calls Satan off. 2. He calls the tempted Soul in, and adminiſters heart-cheering Cordials. 3. He crowns the victory.</p>
                  <p>Firſt he calls Satan off. When God ſeeth this roaring Lyon, preying upon the Vitals of a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, and ready to deſtroy him, God calls him off. For God hath Satan upon a ſtring, and he can go no further, then he permits him. When Satan would have touch'd the life of <hi>Job</hi> (as he had a great mind to it) then God bade him hold; that was precious, and not a fit morſel for the tooth of ſuch a beaſt. Satan never engageth, nor encounters with a Chriſtian, but with Gods leave. He can't ſhoot a fiery dart at the Soul, until God is pleas'd to looſen his Chain, whereby he hath him at com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand. And no ſooner is he in any hopes of a victory over him, but God ſounds a retreat. He muſt and ſhall fall off: for God will not ſuffer him to kill, though he wounds. The Spirits may fail, and the Heart may ake, when Satan thruſts ſore at him; I, but Satan ſhall not give him a deadly wound. If God doth but appear on the behalf of a poor aſſaulted Chriſtian (as he doth in the very nick of time, when there is but an hairs breadth between him and death,) Satan cannot ſtand his ground, but gives back, and the
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:62437:82"/>Soul enjoyes a ſweet releaſe. It is in this caſe, as it was with thoſe, that were poſſeſſed with the Devil. Chriſt did but give the word of command, and Satan preſently obeyed it. As you may ſee, <hi>Mark</hi> 1.23, 24, 25, 26, 27. <hi>And there was in their Synagoue a man that had an unclean ſpirit, and be cryed out, ſaying, Let us alone, what have we to do with thee, thou Jeſus of Nazareth? art thou come to deſtroy us? I know thee who thou art, the holy one of God. And Jeſus rebuked him, ſaying, Hold thy peace, and come out of him. And when the unclean ſpirit bad torn him, and cryed with a loud voice, he came cut of him. And they were all amazed, inſomuch that they queſtioned within themſelves, ſaying, what thing is this? what new doctrine is this? for with authority commandeth he even the unclean ſpirits, and they obey him.</hi> The words hold out the authority of Chriſt, put forth upon Satan in a time when there was the greateſt need thereof. When the poor creature was ready to be devoured by him, Chriſt gave but the word, bade him come out, and he was not able to keep poſſeſſion any longer. Even ſo, when the Soul is aſſaulted by him; if God ſteps but in, and layes his commands upon him, if God doth but ſay it is enough, let him alone; he is preſently bound hand and foot, he cannot ſtir any further. Satan never had, nor ever ſhall have his will upon one true Believer.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, God calls the poor tempted Soul in, and adminiſters heart-cheering cordials to it. A poor Soul never ſtands in more need of a Cordial, then when it hath been worried by this arch enemy of its comfort; and God ſtands as ready to adminiſter it. No ſooner had Chriſt got rid of
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:62437:83"/>him, when he had worſted him in open field, but God diſpatcht away ſome of his glorious atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants, with the beſt Cordials that Heaven could afford. So you may ſee, <hi>Mat.</hi> 4.11. Then the Devil leaveth him, and Angels came and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtred unto him. Surely it muſt needs be ſome rare dainty, that is ſent by the hand of an Angel: what it was is not expreſſed; a Chriſtans expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience doth beſt diſcover it: for as Chriſt was in all things tempted as believers are, ſo one main end of his temptations was, that he might be able to ſuccour thoſe that are tempted, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. <hi>ult. For in that he himſelf ſuffered being tempted, he is able to ſuccour them that are tempted.</hi> He is ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of that relief that he had from his Father, both in the temptations, and after. And as he will have Chriſtians conformable to him in tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations, ſo they ſhall be in relief and comforts; He knows what it was to be tempted, and what it was to be adminiſtred unto after the temptation was over, when he came ſweating out of the field, faint, and weary; and he hath learnt to ſuccour and relieve his people in the like condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and therefore he ſends to them, and ſends for them to come to him, that he may adminiſter to them. He firſt ſends down the holy Spirit into their hearts, to give them notice, that this is a fit ſeaſon for them to come to Court, and apply themſelves to him at the throne of Grace, that they may have grace and mercy, in this time of need: &amp; when they come and make their addreſſes to him, he then applies himſelf to them, &amp; adminiſters to them according to their need. No ſooner was <hi>Luther</hi> releaſed from a grand aſſault of Satan, and come
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:62437:83"/>to himſelf; but preſently he betook himſelf to Chriſt in prayer, and prayed moſt earneſtly, and received great comfort thereupon, and made confeſſion of his Faith. This made him ſay, that Meditation, Prayer, and Temptation makes a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine. I am ſure it makes an experimental Chriſtian.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, God crowns the victory. Though a Chriſtian may be tempted, yet he ſhall overcome, <hi>In all theſe</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>we are more then conquerours,</hi> Ro. 8.37. What is that? Triumphers, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.14. <hi>Now thanks be to God which alwayes cauſeth us to triumph in Chriſt.</hi> As ſure as Satan leads a poor Chriſtian into the field, and there encounters him with his helliſh temptations; God will bring him out with an holy triumph. Hence is that of <hi>Pſal.</hi> 5.11, 12. <hi>But let all thoſe that put their truſt in thee, rejoice: let them ever ſhout for joy, becauſe thou defendeſt them: let them alſo that love thy name, be joyful in thee. For thou, Lord, wilt bleſs the righteous; with favour wilt thou com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs him as with a ſhield.</hi> The Hebrew word ſignifies, <hi>thou wilt crown him with a ſhield.</hi> Some think that the Prophet alludes to a cuſtome of the <hi>Athenians;</hi> who were wont, if a Soldier brought his Shield with him out of the battel ſafe and whole, although he loſt his Sword, to lay his Shield upon his head, and with that, as with a Diadem to crown him. He that holds faſt the ſhield of Faith in an hour of temptation, ſhall wear it on his head as his crown. The trial of a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians faith, <hi>which is much more precious then of gold that periſheth, though it be tried with fire, ſhall be found unto praiſe, honour and glory, at the appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> 1 Pet. 1.7. And hence is that
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:62437:84"/>of the Apoſtle, <hi>I have fought the good fight, I have kept the faith, and from henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteouſneſs,</hi> 2 Tim. 4.7, 8.</p>
                  <p>Thus I have opened the Doctrine, and ſhewed you what relief flows from God to his people, both when their fleſh fails, and when their heart fails. 1. When the natural faculties of the Soul fail. 2. When the infuſed habits of the Soul fail, and 3. When the animal Spirits fail.</p>
                  <p>Now I will give you the grounds and Reaſons thereof.</p>
                  <p>Reaſ. 1. Taken from that near relation that is between God and good men. He is their Father, and they his Children, he is their Husband, and they his Wife. Now this double relation ſpeaks forth that infinite love, that God bears to them, and ſpecial care, that God hath of them. God bears a love to his people, not only like to the love of a Father, but infinitely beyond the love of a Father: the love of a Father to his Child, is but a dark reſemblance of the love of God to his Children: and therefore as God out-loves all Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, ſo he out-does all Parents. His love is the love of an infinite Father, and therefore knows no bounds either of time or meaſure, and his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief is proportionable to his love; Relief wrought by an Almighty arm. See this clearly held forth, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.9. <hi>I will cauſe them to walk by the rivers of water, in ſtraaight way, wherein they ſhall not ſtumble,</hi> And why? <hi>for I am a father unto Iſrael, and Ephraim is my firſt-born.</hi> Divine Paternity is one main ground of a Saints relief. This is the reaſon why he will cauſe them to walk by the rivers of water, in a ſtraight way, wherein they
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:62437:84"/>ſhall not ſtumble, becauſe he is their Father. You know what dear and tender affection a good Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther beareth to his Children, eſpecially to his firſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born. All the Childs wants, weakneſs, and grief, are a trouble and grief to the Father. Much more is God affected with the faintings and failings of his Children. So <hi>Eſ.</hi> 63.8, 9. <hi>He ſaid ſurely, they are my people: ſo he was their Saviour. In all their afflictions he was afflicted, and the Angel of his preſence ſaved them: in his love and in his pity he redeemed them, and he bare them, and carried them all the dayes of old.</hi> The Prophet alludes to the Song of <hi>Moſes,</hi> Deut. 32.11. <hi>As an Eagle ſtirreth up her neſt, fluttereth over her young, ſpreadeth abroad her wings, taketh them, beareth them on her wings: ſo the Lord alone did lead him.</hi> How doth this ſilly creature beſtir her ſelf, when her young ones are in danger. She ſtirs up her neſt, ſhe flut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereth over her young, and ſpreadeth abroad her wings. And if all this will not ſecure them, ſhe takes them up, and bears them upon her wings. But how much more will God, who is the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of ſuch a diſpoſition in his creature, beſtir himſelf, and put forth his Almighty arm for the relief of his dear ones. He will bear them upon the wing of his providence, and carry them out of all danger: Satan ſhall not make a prey of them. If any thing will draw forth the bowels of a creature, the ſame will draw forth the bowels of God; yea much more, <hi>Luke</hi> 11.13. <hi>If ye be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing evil, know how to give good gifts unto your chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, how much more ſhall your heavenly father give the Spirit?</hi> Alas the love of the Creature is but a drop in compariſon of the love of God: and
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:62437:85"/>therefore there muſt needs be more life and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour in the love of God, then in the love of all creatures. As there is more heat in the body of the Sun, then in all its raies, were they all contract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into one ray: ſo it is here. And therefore if an earthly creature be ſo apt to tender the good and welfare of thoſe that belong to it, what propen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity is there in the heart of God, to relieve his people when they are in any ſtraights? Many an Orphan ſits down, and weeps over himſelf in his calamity, and thus bemoans his condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, If my Father were alive, he would not ſee me want, he would pity and relieve me in my ſad condition. Why, Beloved, there is never a child of God, that needs put finger in the eye in this reſpect; for your Father is alive, he lives for ever, he is an everlaſting Father; and as our Text ſaith, <hi>A portion for ever.</hi> And as he is a tender Father, ſo he is a kind Husband. So <hi>Eſ.</hi> 54.5. <hi>For thy maker is thine Husband.</hi> Though he will not relieve and help men, becauſe he is their maker; yet he will relieve and help all thoſe to whom he is an Husband. As long as marriage Covenant holds, God will take the care of his Spouſe, in ſickneſs as well as in health, in poverty as in riches, in weakneſs as in ſtrength. Nay, as a good Husband is moſt tender over his Wife in the time of her weakneſs and ſickneſs: even ſo is God to his Spouſe; ſhe ſhall want nothing that an Almighty hand can provide for her.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 2. Taken from Gods deſign in all his peoples ſtraights and neceſſities. God lets them fall into ſtraights, that he may have the glory of their relief. Whatever hand brings them in, it
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:62437:85"/>is a divine hand that muſt bring them out. We may ſay of all a Chriſtians troubles and failings both of Fleſh and Spirit, as our Saviour ſaid of <hi>Lazarus</hi> his death, <hi>John</hi> 11.4. <hi>This ſickneſs is not unto death, but for the glory of God: that the Son of God might be glorified thereby. Lazarus</hi> muſt die, yea, and be buried alſo, that Chriſt might have the glory of his reſurrection, and that after he had been dead four daies. His ſickneſs was unto death, but not to death eternal, for he had a ſpeedy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection that made his death but a trance, or a long ſleep. Happy <hi>Lazarus</hi> (as one ſaith) though ſick and dead, to be an inſtrument of glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, to be given to God. Thus it is with Saints in their ſpiritual ſickneſſes: they are not unto death, but for the glory of God, that Chriſt may be glorified in their relief. Otherwiſe God is able to prevent them; but might nature alwaies have its courſe, there would be no room for wonders. Nature muſt ſometimes have a ſtop, that the glory of God may appear. Saints comforts and ſtrengths muſt lie a bleeding and die, that the glory of God may appear in their reſurrection. And wherein doth the glory of God appear more, then in ſuch a work as this? This is a glorious work, a work that outſhines all common and ordinary works of God. For God to breath upon dead and dry bones, that they ſhall live again; For God to bring a <hi>Jonas</hi> out of the Whales belly, where he was buried alive three dayes; For God to ſet <hi>Job</hi> upon his leggs again, and to put him into ſtock, both within doors and without, when he had ſtript him of all, and to make his laſt daies better then his firſt; this was a glorious work, a
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:62437:86"/>work wherein God is much glorified. As the beams of the Sun reflected and ſent back, renders the Sun very glorious: So 'tis here.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 3. Taken from the beautifulneſs of Relief in time of neceſſity. Every thing is beautiful in its ſeaſon, <hi>Eccl.</hi> 3.11. And relief is very beautiful in time of neceſſity, becauſe it is ſeaſonable. True neceſſity puts a decorum upon every act, that is requiſite to be put forth therein. It would be very abſurd to do that at one time, which may and ought to be done at another. Should thoſe things, be done for a perſon in health, that are done in the time of his ſickneſs, they would be very ridiculous; but done in ſeaſon, and with due order, they are very comely. God therefore times his works well, and that puts a beauty upon them. Mans neceſſity, is therefore Gods opportunity, to expreſs the riches of his mercy. He calls not the righteous, but ſinners to repentance. Phyſick is not for thoſe that are in health, but for the ſick. So Divine Relief is for thoſe whoſe fleſh fails, and whoſe heart fails. Divine ſtrength is for them, that have no might. And this beautifies Divine diſpenſations. For as God loves to beautifie the the houſe of his glory: ſo he loves to beautifie the works of his glory.</p>
                  <p>Theſe are the Reaſons of the Doctrine.</p>
                  <p>Now before I come to the Application, I muſt ſpeak ſomething to the doubts and ſcruples of weak Chriſtians.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Caſe.</hi> Perhaps ſome will be apt to ſay; If it be true, that Divine Relief flows from God to his people, according to neceſſity, then I am afraid that I do not belong to God, becauſe I have no
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:62437:86"/>experience hereof. My fleſh hath falled, and my heart fails; I, but I do not find relief coming in.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reſolution.</hi> Now to ſuch I have three words, by way of Anſwer.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. I beſeech you take heed of charging God fooliſhly; for, for ought thou underſtandeſt yet, this may prove a vain and fooliſh denying that grace of God, which thou haſt not received in vain. Thou mayeſt have received relief from God in many of theſe caſes, and yet be inſenſible thereof. It may be with thee, as it was with <hi>Jacob:</hi> God hath been with thee, ſupported and relieved thee, and yet thou not know it. God conveys Divine Relief inſenſibly ſometimes, as well as ſeaſonably. When a man is in a ſwoon, many things may be given him to fetch him again, and to recover his Spirits, and yet the man inſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible thereof: it may be ſo with thee. Thou haſt been in a ſpiritual ſwoon, and God hath admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtred many heart-reviving Cordials, that hath brought thee to ſome life again; and yet thou maiſt be inſenſible thereof. It is good therefore to take a more ſtrict ſurvey of thy ſpiritual ſtate; and perhaps upon examination, thou wilt find ſome prints of Divine Relief upon thy Soul. For as wicked men do not find their ſtate ſo bad as it is, becauſe they overlook it: ſo ſometimes good men do not find their ſpiritual ſtate ſo good as it is, becauſe they overlook it. The piece of Silver that the woman thought ſhe had loſt, was in the houſe, although ſhe knew not where it was, until ſhe did light a candle, ſweep the houſe, and ſeek diligently for it; as you may ſee, <hi>Luke</hi> 15.8. God may have ſent thee a token of his love, and thou
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:62437:87"/>mayſt have it in thy heart, and yet not know it. Thou hadſt beſt ſet up a candle, even the word of God in thine heart, and by that light ſearch thy heart, and that diligently, and then thou mayſt find it. 'Tis true, ſome particular acts of relieving grace, are ſo full and ſtrong upon the heart of a Chriſtian, that he cannot be inſenſible thereof: but there are others, that are conveyed to the Soul, in a more ſecret and inſenſible way. God writes a Letter of conſolation to the Soul, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in ſo ſmall a character, that ſhe hath much ado to read it: it is hard for her to ſpell out the mind of God therein. God deals with Chriſtians, as ſome wiſe Phyſitians do with ſome of their Patients; they give them Phyſick, and they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver know of it; ſomething muſt be put into their Beer, or ſomething into their broth: Even ſo God gives much relief to Chriſtians in their ſpiritual weakneſs, that the Soul knows not of. Little did <hi>Jacobs</hi> brethren know that they had their money in their Sacks, when they came homewards out of the land of <hi>Egypt:</hi> No, when they came to bait, and opened their Sacks, they found it. Even thus it may be with many a child of God; thy money, thy relief may be in thy heart, and yet thou ignorant of it. Perhaps when thou comeſt to refreſh, and lookeſt within to ſee what thou haſt, thou mayſt find that which thou dreamedſt not of.</p>
                  <p>There are three things that ſometimes hide re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief from the eye of the Soul, and are an occaſion of the Souls miſtake.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. God works gradually herein; The cure is not perfected the firſt day that God takes thee in
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:62437:87"/>hand, and ſome diſeaſes are long before they will be cured. Now here may be a great miſtake. If thou thinkeſt that God hath made no applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to thee, becauſe thou art not perfectly cured of thy diſtemper, thou doſt wrong God exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly. Thou mayſt be in a tendency to a cure, God may have done much for thee, and yet thy ſore may run, and thy wound be very wide ſtill. Look again therefore, and ſee if there be never a Plaiſter upon the ſore: thou mayſt be in a way of cure, though not cured. Strength may be given in, although thou art not ſtrengthened with all might. Here may be rather matter of thankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, then of complaint, and thou ſhouldſt rather give God the glory of what he hath done for thee, be it never ſo little, then ſit down dejected, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe all is not yet done, that is requiſite to a perfect cure. Bleſs God for a little, and that will be the way to obtain more. Thou mayſt get that with a thankful ſpirit, which thou ſhalt never get with a froward.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. God works variouſly: he relieves all his people, but not all alike: he cures all, but not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies with one and the ſame receipt, nor after one and the ſame manner and method. He varies his diſpenſations much; and therefore here may be a miſtake, that becauſe God doth not make the very ſame applications to thee, which he doth to another, therefore thou concludeſt, that God hath done nothing for thy cure, and relief. 'Tis here, as in the caſe of converſion. Some Chriſtians are apt to think they are not ſavingly converted, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe God did not work upon their hearts in the ſame way and manner, that others are wrought
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:62437:88"/>upon. They were not brought under thoſe legal terrours, nor held under a ſpirit of bondage, in that meaſure and degree, that others have been. But this is to tie up God to one way of working grace, when as he varies in his working. Even ſuch a miſtake may be in this caſe. Perhaps thou thinkeſt that God hath afforded thee no relief, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it came not in the ſame way to thee, as it hath done to others. 'Tis good to eye and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the experiences of other Chriſtians, but not to limit God by them. As the thoughts of God will be ever above our thoughts, ſo the waies of his providence will be ever paſt finding out. No man can trace God in ſome of his wayes, they are ſo myſterious. God doth not alwaies leave the print of his foot-ſteps where he goeth. The way of an Eagle in the Air, the way of a Ship in the midſt of the Sea, the way of a Serpent upon a Rock, are not ſo untraceable, as many of the waies of God. It is mercy that God knows our Souls in the time of our failing, though we cannot know every way and method of his relieving us.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Sometimes diſtempers work croſs, that what is appointed for the cure of one, is the occaſion of another. 'Tis ſometimes ſo in the body natural, and it may prove ſo in the body ſpiritual. When God is curing the weakneſs and failing of grace, and that begins to recover its wonted ſtrength, then ſpiritual pride breaks forth, ſome ſelf-admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration begins to bud out, and that puts God upon a new work. It is very rare for a Chriſtian to be ſtrong in ſome of his graces, and not to be too much exalted in his Spirit: or for God to lift the heart up in the ſenſe of his love, and not grow wanton
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:62437:88"/>and ſecure. 'Tis pitty that fair weather ſhould do any hurt: But 'tis thus with ſome ſouls, that the Sun-ſhine of Divine Favour and the light of Gods countenance is ſo ill emproved, that the heart grows worſe with it, and like bodies that have long faſted, or are newly brought out of a lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing fit of ſickneſs, take a ſurfeit of their diet, and fall again, it may be, into ſome worſe diſeaſe. Now here may be a great miſtake in this, if thou thinkeſt, that becauſe new failings and new diſtempers break forth, God hath done nothing towards thy cure. Had not thy diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers wrought ſo croſs, thou mighteſt have been upon thy feet again long before.</p>
                  <p>This is the firſt particular by way of anſwer to this caſe; Thou mayeſt have received great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief from God and not know of it. And I have ſhewen you wherein the miſtake may lie; in the gradation or variety of Gods working, or in the croſs working of ſoul diſtempers.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Thou ſayeſt that thou canſt not ſet thy ſeal to the truth of the Doctrine, becauſe thou haſt had no experience hereof. Conſider therefore in the next place, that it may be, Gods time of relieving thee, is not yet come. God will come in a time, that is moſt ſeaſonable, though not always when we expect it. Thy time may be come, but Gods time is not yet come. Gods hand is not ſhortened, nor his arm weakened, nor his heart ſhut up; I but his time is lengthened out beyond thy expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation. Some are fain to wait a long time for relief, before it comes; their eyes fail, while they wait for God. So did <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 69.3. <hi>Mine eyes fail while I wait for my God.</hi> It may be thou
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:62437:89"/>haſt thought the time very long. I, but if God ſeeth it good thou muſt wait ſtill; We read in the Goſpel, of a man that had an infirmity thirty eight years; a long time, <hi>Job.</hi> 5.5. And what if God will try thee with thine infirmity as long, yet when his time is come, relief ſhall be given in; thou ſhalt be made whole. It may be thy caſe is not bad enough yet: God will take thee a pin lower yet; hee'l draw a little more blood from thee; and when there is ſcarce an hairs breadth between thee and death or ruine, then relief ſhall come. And therefore do not conclude, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe thou haſt no experience yet of the truth of the Doctrine, that either it is not true, or thou haſt no ſaving intereſt in God; for though thou haſt no experience hereof yet, thou mayeſt have great and wonderful experience here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Conſider that a Saints intereſt in God de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends not upon his ſenſe of Divine Relief, but up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the All-ſufficiency of Free-grace. Thy intereſt will hold when thy ſenſe thereof is loſt. Though thou mayſt think, that thou haſt loſt thy hold on God, and canſt not act faith on him, yet, if once thou haſt had an intereſt in God, God will not looſe his hold on thee. What though thou faileſt; thy fleſh and heart fails thee? yet Divine Strength cannot fail. <hi>In the Lord Jehovah is ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting ſtrength, Eſay</hi> 26.4. And as long as God hath an arm to hold thee, thou ſhalt not be loſt. Remember I pray thee (ſaith <hi>Eliphaz</hi> to <hi>Job</hi>) <hi>Who ever periſhed, being innocent? or where were the righteous out off? Job</hi> 4.7. The ruine and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing of ſouls is when they are totally and finally
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:62437:89"/>forſaken of God, that God will not own them, nor be a God unto them; when they are utterly and eternally driven from the gratious preſence of God, never to ſee the well-pleaſed face of God: I, but who ever ſee the innocent thus to periſh, or the righteous thus cut off? <hi>Joh.</hi> 10.28. <hi>I do give unto them eternal life, and they ſhall never periſh.</hi> What though thou canſt not ſee that hand that holds thy ſoul in life; yet it will ſo hold thee, that thy ſpiritual life ſhall not be taken from thee. If thoſe afflictions and diſtempers which make thy heart to fail, could cauſe the ſtrength of Gods free grace to fail, then thou wouldſt be in danger of an eternal ruine; they might prejudice thy in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in God: but though theſe have ſome influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence upon thee, they have no ſuch influence upon God. Now as long as they can have no influence upon the grace of God to weaken that, they can have no influence upon thy intereſt in God. And therefore do not conclude againſt thy ſelf; for though thy hand of faith be grown ſo weak that it can't take faſt hold on God, yet Gods hand is ſtrong and that will hold thee faſt. So ſaith the Prophet, <hi>nevertheleſs I am continually with thee, thou haſt holden me by my right hand, verſ.</hi> 23. God held him faſt, when he was ready to drop from God. He had loſt the ſenſe of his intereſt in God: I, but his intereſt in God was not loſt. God was his God, though he did not know it. And ſo God may be thine, thou mayſt have a ſure intereſt in him, although thou canſt not find the prints of Gods feet in thy ſoul, nor trace him in his ways of goodneſs towards thee. And know this, that it is better for thee to have an intereſt in God,
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:62437:90"/>although thou knoweſt it not, then to have ſtrong preſumptions and be deceived. The want of ſenſe and feeling of our intereſt in God is no ſin, though it be a great affliction. Chriſt himſelf was with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſenſe; I, he was ſo deep in it, that when he was upon the croſs, he cried out, <hi>Why haſt thou forſaken me?</hi> I, but a groundleſs preſumption is a ſin, and leads to eternal ruine. None ever pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed for want of faith of evidence; but hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds periſh for want of faith of adherence. Oh, bleſſed is the man who believes, and ſees not; that can ſay with <hi>Job, Though he ſlay me, yet will I truſt in him. Though my fleſh fails, and my heart fails, yet I will believe that he is my ſtrength and por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for ever.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus I have anſwered this caſe, and ſo made way to application.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 1. Hence we may infer the ſad and woful condition of thoſe who have no intereſt in God: for they that have no intereſt in God, can expect no relief from God in a time of neceſſity. Wicked men have their failings, their fleſh fails them ſometimes and their hearts fail them; but no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief comes from God at thoſe times. Of all men they are moſt to be pityed: for there is no help, no relief for them. <hi>If I be wicked</hi> (ſaith <hi>Job</hi>) woe <hi>unto me, Job</hi> 10.15. <hi>i. e.</hi> If I be wicked, I can expect no mercy; no comfort from God. Nay, hear what God ſaith himſelf to ſuch, <hi>Eſay</hi> 65.13. <hi>Therefore thus ſaith the Lord, behold my ſervants ſhall eat, but ye ſhall be hungry: behold my ſervants ſhall drink but ye ſhall be thirſty: behold my ſervants ſhall rejoyce but ye ſhall be aſhamed: behold my ſervants ſhall ſing for joy of heart, but ye ſhall cry for ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:62437:90"/>of heart, and ſhall bowl for vexation of ſpirit.</hi> The meaning is, God will not afford them any comfort or relief in times of diſtreſs. When God invites his own ſervants to feaſt with him, they muſt be ſhut out. And if God helps not, who can? No, without me ye ſhall bow down, ſaith God, <hi>Eſay</hi> 10.3. The wounds of the wicked are deſperate wounds: there is no cure for them. Mark that of <hi>Job, for what portion is there from above? and what inheritance of the Almighty from on high? is not deſtruction to the wicked? and a ſtrange puniſhment to the workers of iniquity?</hi> The latter verſe is an anſwer to the former, and the ſenſe is this, all the portion and inheritance that the wicked can have from God above, is deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and a ſtrange puniſhment, <hi>Job</hi> 20.2, 3. God is the ſtrength and portion of a godly man, when his fleſh and heart fails him; but the wicked have no other portion from God, then utter deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on &amp; a ſtrange puniſhment. So <hi>Job</hi> 20.27, 28, 29. <hi>The heavens ſhall reveal his iniquity and the earth ſhall riſe up againſt him; the increaſe of his houſe ſhall depart, and his goods ſhall flow away in the day of his wrath:</hi> This is the portion of a wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed man from God, and the heritage appointed to him by God; Here is heaven and earth ſet againſt him, the heavens ſhall reveal his ſin, and the earth ſhall puniſh him for his ſin. But is there no relief for him in God? No, This is the portion of a wicked man from God. The caſe of ſuch a man muſt needs be very black and diſmal, when heaven and earth, and all the creatures therein are armed againſt him and muſtred up by a Divine Hand: Where can he have any relief then? If
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:62437:91"/>God were for thee, 'tis no matter what ſets it ſelf againſt thee? But if God be againſt thee, 'tis no matter what is for thee, it will not help thee. If miſery and deſtruction be all the portion that God will allow thee, there is nothing then can ſave thee. If this be all thou haſt to live upon to eternity, thou wilt have a miſerable living of it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 2. Hence all thoſe that have intereſt in God, may fetch comfort: here is a well, out of which all good men may draw the water of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation with joy. And what can afford greater comfort to you, then this Doctrine doth: that divine relief ſhall be adminiſtred unto you, in time of your neceſſity; when your fleſh fails, and your heart fails, God will be the ſtrength of your heart? It is a great comfort to a Merchant-adventurer, to have an aſſurance from the Enſuring Office, that his Adventure at Sea, ſhall be made good to him in caſe the Ship miſcarries. Even ſo it may be to a childe of God, to have an aſſurance given him, that if all fails him without, and within, he ſhall have relief from God. Why, this Text and Doctrine gives thee an aſſurance hereof; and therefore, as <hi>Job</hi> ſaid, hear it diligently, and let it be your conſolation. You may take comfort in your greateſt diſcomforts, that you ſhall have comfort. If there be enough in God to relieve and help you, you ſhall not want relief.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Obj.</hi> But the doubting Chriſtian may ſay; I could take comfort in this truth, had I not walked ſo unworthy of that former relief, I have received from God. I can truly ſay, the Lord hath magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied the riches of his grace upon me; but I have abuſed it, and it may be juſt with him to caſt me
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:62437:91"/>off for ever. He hath helped me when I was in a low condition, he hath ſtrengthened me when I was in a weak ſtate: but I have not made ſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able returns thereunto, and therefore how can I expect relief?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> Now to ſuch I have five things to ſay.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The unſuitableneſs of a believer to, and his unworthineſs of relief cannot ſtop the current thereof. As divine relief is not adminiſtred to us upon the account of our worthineſs, as if we did merit it: ſo our unworthineſs of it, nor unſuitable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to it, ſhall not prevent it. Thy miſcarriages may cauſe God to correct thee with failing of thy fleſh and of thy heart, but cannot cauſe God to caſt thee off, if thou haſt an intereſt in him. No, that love, that moves him to correct thee for thy good, will alſo move him to relieve thee, when thou art under the rod of correction. A moſt full place for proof of this you have, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 106.43, 44, 45. <hi>Many times did he deliver them: but they provoked him with their counſels; and were brought low for their iniquity. Nevertheleſs he regarded their affliction, when he heard their cry. And he remembred for them his covenant, and repented according to the multitude of his mercies.</hi> Here is the caſe; Firſt, God afforded them relief, <hi>He had many times de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered them.</hi> Secondly, Here is their unanſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableneſs to that mercy. <hi>They provoked him with their counſels.</hi> Thirdly, Although they did de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve to be caſt off, yet God did not caſt them off; but as a father corrects his child, whom he loves, ſo did the Lord correct them. <hi>He brought them low for their iniquity.</hi> Fourthly, Did he leave them then? No. <hi>He regarded their
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:62437:92"/>affliction, when he heard their cry.</hi> And why was all this? <hi>He remembred for them his covenant.</hi> God did not eye their tempers ſo much as their intereſt, nor the frame of their Spirits, or carriage towards him, as his Covenant made to them. The unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſs of a Chriſtian comes, and pleads againſt the Souls relief in time of neceſſity, yet Gods Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant will carry the day for it. And though a Chriſtian may have too much forgotten God, yet God cannot forget his Covenant.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. There is nothing more unbecoming a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, then to doubt of divine relief after expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience had thereof. Thy other miſcarriages and failings may ſeem worſe in the eye of men; but nothing ſeems worſe in the eye of God, then unbelief. There is no ſin (as one obſerves) ſo often and ſo properly called a provocation, as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief is. It may be thou thinkeſt it but thy mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty and humility to make queſtion, or to doubt of thy relief from God; and thou art afraid to reſt upon God for it in a time of need: I, but thou little imagineſt what thou doſt herein: Why, hereby thou provokeſt God. So you may ſee, <hi>Deut.</hi> 9.7, 8. <hi>Remember and forget not, how thou provrkedſt the Lord thy God. Alſo in Hereb ye provoked the Lord.</hi> Now how was that? You may ſee, <hi>Exod.</hi> 17.6, 7. <hi>Behold, I will ſtand before thee there upon the rock in Horeb,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>And thou ſhalt ſmite the rock,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>And he called the place Maſſah and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ribah, temptation and ſtrife, becauſe of the chiding of the children of Iſrael, and becauſe they tempted the Lord, ſaying, Is the Lord among us or not?</hi> They doubted of relief from God in the want of water, and hereby they tempted and provoked him.</p>
                  <pb n="157" facs="tcp:62437:92"/>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Obj.</hi> But it may be thou wilt ſay. <hi>Iſraels</hi> ſin lay chiefly in doubting of Gods power: I, but I do not doubt of the power of God; I know God can do all things, and nothing is impoſſible to him: All my doubt is about the will of God, for though he can do all he will do, yet God will not do all he can.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> Now to this I anſwer. To doubt of Gods will in reference to thoſe things, which he hath promiſed to do, is as great a ſin, as to doubt of Gods power; for herein thou calleſt the faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of God into queſtion, and makeſt him that is truth it ſelf a liar; and therefore this muſt needs be a provoking ſin. Nay further, the attributes of God are ſo linked together, as that no man ſins againſt one through unbelief, but he ſins againſt all. As he that breaks one command of God, breaks all: So he that tempts God in one, tempts God in all. He that doubts of the will of God revealed in a promiſe, doth implicitely doubt of the power of God, which is engaged for the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of it.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Confidence in God for relief before thou ſtandeſt in need thereof, is a notable help to the exerciſe of faith in a time of need. He that diſtruſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth God when he is full, will hardly truſt in God when he is in want. I know that many will ſay, they believe in God, when all things go well with them; and yet when faith is put to a trial indeed, they diſcover that they have little or no faith in them: but he that ſhrinks before the trial comes, will hardly hold out in the trial. It is not an eaſie matter to raiſe thy Soul unto a believing frame; it is not done in an inſtant; there muſt be a daily
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:62437:93"/>exerciſe thereof. It is good for us to put faith to its trial, before God puts us upon trial, that we may have ſome gueſs at the ſtrength of our faith. When a Chriſtian by dayly exerciſe hath enured himſelf to live the life of faith, and to caſt doubts out of his ſpirit, he can with greater eaſe live by faith, when he hath nothing elſe to live upon. When a Chriſtian can truly ſay, I have truſted God many years, and he hath not forſaken me, he will be apt to ſay, Shall I diſtruſt him now, when my condition calls more for his help, then hitherto it hath done? I know whom I have believed (ſaith S. <hi>Paul</hi>) and I am perſwaded, that he is able to keep that which I have committed to him, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.12. <hi>Paul</hi> doth not ſay, <hi>I know whom I do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, but whom I have believed:</hi> he had maintained the life of faith, by a continued exerciſe thereof, and therefore was the more confident of relief from God in a time of need.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Though, through thy miſcarriages, thou haſt rendered thy ſelf unworthy of relief in time of need: yet God is moſt worthy to be truſted for relief. Though thou doſt not deſerve relief at his hands, yet he deſerves thy truſting in him. To truſt in God, is a duty that all men owe to God. As all men are bound to love God, and to fear him: ſo they are bound to truſt in him. And God deſerves this truſt. He and he alone ought to be the ſole foundation of every mans confidence: but eſpecially of thoſe, who have had experience of him. It is common for one man to ſay of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that is tried and found faithful, he is wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to be truſted; much more is God. He hath bought thy confidence with the price of many
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:62437:93"/>mercies; and ſhall God loſe his purchaſe? this would be an act of injuſtice to him. And therefore ſay within thy heart, though I am not worthy of relief from God, yet becauſe he is moſt worthy to be truſted in, I will truſt in him for ever.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Though thou haſt abuſed relieving mercy, yet thou haſt not ſinned it out. Relieving mercy is a fountain that can never be drawn dry. And as thou mayeſt fetch new ſupplies of ſtrength to help thee againſt miſcarriages; ſo thou mayeſt fetch new pardons of thy miſcarriages. And the ſpeedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt way to obtain a pardon, is to exerciſe faith on God in Chriſt, for a pardon. So <hi>Acts</hi> 13.38, 39. <hi>Be it known unto you therefore, men and brethren that through this man is preached unto you the forgiveneſs of ſins, and by him all that believe are juſtified from all things, from which ye could not be juſtified by the law of Moſes.</hi> Obſerve this; by Chriſt all that believe are juſtified. Now if God juſtifies, who can condemn? <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.33, 34. <hi>Who ſhall lay any thing to the charge of Gods elect? It is God that ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifieth Who is he that condemneth? It is Chriſt that died yea rather that is riſen again, who is even at the right hand of the father, who alſo maketh inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion for us.</hi> Now if thy ſin be pardoned, then there is nothing, which thou canſt poſſibly fear will prevent thy relief; and therefore be perſwaded to ſet faith on work in Jeſus Chriſt. Go out of thy ſelf to him for righteouſneſs, that thou mayeſt be found in him; and believe that with God there is ſtill mercy for thee, and plenteous redemption. Thus did <hi>David</hi> fetch in comfort againſt a time of need, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 130.3, 4. <hi>If thou Lord ſhouldſt mark iniquities, O Lord who ſhall ſtand? but there is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:62437:94"/>with thee, that thou mayeſt be feared. I wait for the Lord, my ſoul doth wait, and in his word do I hope.</hi> i. e. If Gods eye ſhould be wholly fixt upon our ſins, and not upon Chriſts righteouſneſs, we could not be juſtified; we ſhould never be able to ſtand in his ſight. And if our eye be only fixt upon our ſins, and not upon Gods mercy in Chriſt; we ſhould never attain to any confidence in God for relief in time of need. I but now, ſaith <hi>David</hi> upon this ground: <hi>I can wait for the Lord, and hope in his word.</hi> Yea, upon this very ground he exhorts others to hope, <hi>v.</hi> 7. <hi>Let Iſrael hope in the Lord, for with the Lord there is mercy.</hi> Still there is mercy; though we have lived upon this ſtock of mercy all our daies, yet there is enough ſtill; nay, there is nothing ſpent of it. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore take home the comfort hereof with you, that divine relief ſhall be adminiſtred unto you in the time of your greateſt need. When your fleſh fails, and your heart fails, God will be the ſtrength of your heart, and portion for ever.</p>

Open thou mine eyes, that I may behold wonderous things out of thy law.</hi> And is not here a wonder? for here is an inviſible glory, repreſented to us by a viſible thing; divine counſel ſet forth in an Hiero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glyphick: For in the foregoing verſe, we have a wheel upon the earth by the living creatures, with his four faces, and here we have a wheel in the middle of a wheel. This, this is the amazing glory.</p>
                  <pb n="164" facs="tcp:62437:96"/>
                  <p>By the one wheel upon the earth, with its four faces, ſome do underſtand the Univerſe, or vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible World; which is as a wheel, round, and ſubject to wheelings and turnings, mutations and changes, and that in all the four quarters thereof; and much may be ſaid for this interpretation. I ſhall only take leave to add this; that this viſible World is to be conſidered, as conſiſting of, and conteining in it, thoſe ſecond cauſes, inſtruments and means, whereby God wheels about his own deſigns and plots, together with their ſeveral appearances and faces, and yet with one likeneſs <hi>in conſpectu Dei.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This is one part of the Viſion, the wheel with its four faces.</p>
                  <p>The other is the wheel in the middle of a wheel. This may be taken two waies.</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>1. Tranſverſly.</item>
                     <item>2. Comprehenſively.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p>Firſt tranſverſly; and ſo two things are obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable in it.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That the wheels ſeemed croſs to one another, and entangled one in another, as the lines and circles in a Globe, cut and croſs one another; ſo ſay ſome. And if ſo? they do moſt lively re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent the croſsneſs, intricacy, and entangledneſs that is in all ſecond cauſes each to other, both in their natures and their motions. The whole world is but entangled and croſs wheels; but I ſhall not detain you herein. And therefore,</p>
                  <p n="2">2. There are others that ſay, that all the wheels made up one ſpherical figure, touching themſelves at right angles, that without turning or delay, they might run and roul any way, on any ſide. And if ſo? then they are a moſt lively
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:62437:96"/>emblem of that harmony that is in all things; for though croſs in themſelves, yet they ſerve to make one globe, and do carry on one ultimate deſign. According to that of the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.28. <hi>All things work together for good.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This is the import of the wheels, if taken tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſly. But</p>
                  <p>Secondly, They may be conſidered compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſively; one wheel within another. As in ſome Watches, there are wheels one in another, and one that moves the reſt.</p>
                  <p>And if ſo? then here we have a Divine Myſtery that outſhines the former, <hi>viz.</hi> That amazing glory of Divine Providence, which works in all created beings, moves them, and ſets them to work, as the great and ſprincipal wheel moves the leſſer and inferiour. And this, this is the true form and work of the wheels. The wheel of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine providence is ſet up in all wheels, as the prime and principal wheel.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Obſer.</hi> From hence we ſhall obſerve, That divine providence is admirable, and Soul-amazing. And this will appear, if we take into conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, theſe three particulars.</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>1. The <hi>eſſe,</hi> The being and conſtitution of this divine wheel.</item>

                  </p>
                  <p>Firſt, The being of this divine wheel is very admirable: for it is made up of infinite and tranſcendent glory.</p>

                  </list>
                  <p>Both theſe beams of glory are infinite and tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendent, and do make up one moſt glorious and incomprehenſible wheel in the divine being. 'Tis true, they are diſtinguiſhed as to us, yet they are but one in God. And ſo ſaith the School-man. <hi>Cum eſſe &amp; intelligere in Deo indiſtincta ſunt, ipſum per ſuam ſcientiam cauſare res oportet, adjuncta tamen voluntate.</hi> Or rather take it in the words of the holy Apoſtle, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.11. <hi>He worketh all things after the counſel of his own will.</hi> For as the will of God, is the practick principle in the God-head: ſo it is a will full of Divine light, wiſdom, and counſel, directing it in all its determinations and reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Hence it is, that as there is not the leaſt ſpot of error herein; ſo there is not poſt-repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance thereof, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 33.11. <hi>The counſel of the Lord ſtandeth for ever, the thoughts of his heart from generation to generation:</hi> for it is the counſel of his will; or divine will joined with the higheſt light, wiſdom, and reaſon. An infinite will ſparkling and ſhining with infinite counſel and reaſon; and indeed, the God-head it ſelf muſt be divided, or elſe a ſeparation cannot be made between the will of God and the wiſdom of God; no! (but as I hinted before) they make up one wheel in the divine being, and this is that which Divines call eternal providence. It is nothing elſe (as I hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly conceive) but one eternal and undivided act of Divine Will, moſt wiſely determining and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointing all things with the moſt appoſite means and higheſt end, and that after a moſt exact order and method. <hi>Ipſa ratio ordinis rerum in finem providentia in Deo nominatur.</hi> 'Tis true, as the
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:62437:97"/>pre-ordained means, ſo the pre-ordained ends are various; I, but the higheſt and ultimate end of all his plots and contrivances, workings, and admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrations, is the glorifying and exalting the riches of his Eſſential Glory. This I ſay, is the ſupream end, the end of ends, the Corner Stone, whereon all the deſigns and purpoſes of God do lean, and the mark at which they are levelled; All other ends, though co-ordained with this, do ſtrike ſail to this, and in this reſpect are but as means ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to effect it; For God being the firſt and the laſt, the higheſt being and the beſt good, muſt needs be the higheſt and the ultimate end of all his own counſels.</p>
                  <p>And that in two reſpects.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. In reſpect of his <hi>Philantie</hi> or ſelf-love, which is above all that love, that he bears to any other being; Great is his love to the man Chriſt Jeſus, So <hi>John</hi> 5.20. <hi>The Father loveth the Son, and ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth him all things that himſelf doth, and he will ſhew him greater works, that ye may marvel.</hi> I but though his love to Chriſt be thus great, yet not ſo great as that which he beareth to himſelf: nay take all that Love which he expreſſeth to all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings below himſelf, and you will find it to fall abundantly ſhort of that love, which is in God to himſelf; For all Divine Acts are proportioned to their objects, and diverſified by them, that love which God bears to a created being is propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned to ſuch a being; and that love that God beareth to himſelf, is proportioned to himſelf, as he is an uncreated and an infinite being. Now as there is a vaſt diſproportion between a created and an uncreated, a finite and an infinite being;
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:62437:98"/>ſo there is a vaſt diſproportion between the love that God hath for the one, and that which he hath for the other; he being the higheſt being, muſt needs love himſelf with the higheſt love, and therefore cannot but propoſe himſelf, and his own glory as his higheſt end; For elſe he ſhould expreſs greater love to a creature, then to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, to a leſs good, then to the beſt good. But again,</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It muſt needs be ſo, in reſpect of the nature of an end, eſpecially of the higheſt end. For this lieth in two things,
<list>
                        <item>1. In terminating the act.</item>
                        <item>2. In ſo doing to give reſt to the agent.</item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>For as the end gives a beginning to the act, by drawing forth the agent: So the agent is carried on to the attaining of that end, and cannot reſt until that be accompliſhed; the truth is, the work is never perfect but in that, and there is no reſt but in that.</p>
                  <p>Now I beſeech you tell me, what is there in any being below the ſupream, that may be the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt end in theſe two reſpects; For can it be ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined that a leſs good can draw forth God to act, when as there is a greater? Surely, no; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he being the higheſt and the beſt good, muſt needs be the higheſt and ultimate end of all his counſels, determinations and workings; for in himſelf, and his own glory.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. His work is perfected. And</p>
                  <p n="2">2. He himſelf hath content, reſt and ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. <hi>Will I eat the fleſh of bulls, or drink the blood of goats</hi> (ſaith God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 50.13)? No! but offer un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:62437:98"/>God thankſgiving; This, this is the joy and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light of his heart.</p>
                  <p>Thus we have given a diſpatch to the firſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of this Divine wheel.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Conſider the motion thereof, and you will find, that an admirable being hath an admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable motion; And therefore it is repreſented to us by a <hi>Wheel in the middle of a Wheel,</hi> noting out the intenſneſs of its motion; As 'tis ſaid of <hi>Elias,</hi> that he prayed in prayer, <hi>i. e.</hi> he was intenſe in prayer. <hi>So a Wheel in the middle of a Wheel,</hi> notes the intenſneſs of its motion; it hath heat and fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour in it, which makes its motion quick and powerful, and is an argument of its ſupereminent excellency, and incomparable uſe; 'tis true, crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture motions are ſometimes too intenſe, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore do miſcarry, and are of dreadful conſequence. I, but that proceeds from their irregularity and diſorder. Zeal is good in a good act; I, but if it be not regulated and ordered by a Divine Light, and an Holy prudence, it puts the agent upon a great hazard of miſcarrying therein. As a ſhip is never in greater danger, then when her ſails are ſpread, fill'd with a ſtrong guſt of wind, and her ſelf upon the greateſt ſpeed, in caſe that ſhe be not well ballaſt, or wants a skilful Pilot. I, but though it be thus oft-times in creature moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, yet 'tis not ſo in the Divine; For in theſe there are not only heat, but light; And therefore in Sacred Writ, there is frequent mention made of the eyes of the Lord. So 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 16.9. &amp; <hi>Zech.</hi> 4.10. <hi>The eyes of the Lord run to and fro through the whole earth.</hi> Noting out, that all the motions of this internal and Divine Wheel are lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minous
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:62437:99"/>motions, full of light; as 'tis always in motion, full of activity, vigour and life, ſo it is admirably regular in its motions; it turns and rolls in a ſtreight line. When the eyes of this wheel look various ways, yet the wheel carries on one deſign. I ſay, this one wheel in the middle of a wheel is all light, all eye. And therefore there can be no miſcarriage in its motion; No! as its determinations, ſo all its motions are regular and and orderly.</p>
                  <p>This is that which Divines call actual provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence; which differs from eternal no otherwiſe then execution from determination.</p>
                  <p>Eternal providence is as the head, and actual providence is as the hand; Actual providence is the evidence of eternal, 'tis the breaking up of Divine Counſel. But you muſt note this, that eternal providence did not ceaſe to be, when actual providence firſt took place, but actual providence waits on eternal, that Divine Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel may be put in execution, and all things acted according to the heavenly pattern; For ſo it is ſaid in the forementioned place, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.11. <hi>That God worketh all things after the counſel of his own will.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Eternal providence is as the womb, wherein all things are conceived, and actual providence is as the midwiſe, whereby they are brought forth, as the nurſe whereby they are preſerved and brought up, and as the governeſs whereby they are ruled and ordered in their ſtation and motion.</p>
                  <p>And ſo there is a threefold motion in the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Wheel.</p>
                  <pb n="171" facs="tcp:62437:99"/>
                  <list>
                     <item>1. Production.</item>
                     <item>2. Conſervation.</item>
                     <item>3. Gubernation.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p>Firſt, Production, for actual providence is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly exerciſed in delivering Divine Counſel of its off-ſpring; and nothing but the Active Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence of God can bring to paſs the Counſels of God; Eternal Providence is Gods thinking of things, and actual providence is Gods ſpeaking of things, that the thoughts of God may become a work of God. Yea, let him but ſpeak the word and the thing is done, as you have it, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 33.9. <hi>He ſpake the word and it was done. Let there be light, and there was light.</hi> Thus, thus (I ſay) this one Wheel in the middle of a Wheel, Wheels a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout all Gods Divine Counſels and predetermina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions into actual being; let things be never ſo great, glorious, and unexpected, yet they are wheeled about into actual being by a word of his mouth: Divine Plots and contrivances do not, ſhall not prove abortive; but are and ſhall be brought to light in their due time. So <hi>Gen.</hi> 41.32. The thing is eſtabliſhed, and God will bring it to paſs; 'tis firſt eſtabliſhed in the Divine Mind, and then brought to paſs by a Divine Hand; And therefore ſaith the Prophet, <hi>Zeph.</hi> 2. The begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning. <hi>Gather together, yea, gather together, Oh na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion not deſired, before the decree bring forth.</hi> The Divine Mind had conceived, and time was now at hand, when it ſhould be delivered of its off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring. And indeed, Divine Providence is never idle, but always at work, in bringing forth that which is conceived in the Divine Mind, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:62437:100"/>ſhall hinder. I will work (ſaith God <hi>Eſay</hi> 43.13.) and who ſhall let? The queſtion im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies a negation, <hi>q. d.</hi> None ſhall let. No 'tis not in the power of earth or hell, to ſcotch this Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Wheel in its motion; As God wants no wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom to contrive; ſo he wants no power to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute; and therefore may well be reſolute herein, and ſay as you have it, <hi>Eſay</hi> 46.10. <hi>I will do all my pleaſure.</hi> But</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Shall a Divine Off-ſpring be left to the wide world for maintenance and preſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? No! Divine providence is as well exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in the one as in the other. What ſhe brings forth, ſhe will bring up, to that which ſhe gives a being, to that ſhe will afford Divine In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence for her ſuſtentation and ſupport in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. And</p>
                  <p>This is called by Divines, the manutenency of God, becauſe God doth uphold things by a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Hand. <hi>Thou haſt made</hi> (ſaith <hi>Nehemiah, Chap.</hi> 9.6.) <hi>and thou preſerveſt all things;</hi> and the Apoſtle aſſerts the ſame, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.3. <hi>He up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holdeth all things by the word of his power,</hi> or <hi>by his powerful word.</hi> For as the word of God gives a being; ſo it upholds in being; thou holdeſt our ſoul in life, faith <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 66.9. The four wheels are upheld by this one wheel, or elſe they would ſoon turn into their firſt nothing, <hi>annihi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latio eſt ſubſtructio influxus divini,</hi> Let God hide his face, and then the wheels are ſcotched, but let him withdraw his ſupporting influence, and then wheels are no wheels. I, but though we read of deſtruction and diſſolution in Scripture, yet we no where read of annihilation. 'Tis true, ſometimes
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:62437:100"/>God is pleaſed to make uſe of a wheel for a time, and all that time hath his work upon it, and then of a ſudden lays it aſide; I, but he never lays any wheel aſide, until he hath wrought and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected as much by it, as he intended; and indeed, as he hath various works, and various wheels to carry on his work by; ſo ſometimes he moves and works by one, and ſometimes by another. I, but as long as he hath any work to do by any one, ſo long he maintains and upholds it in motion, as well as in being; Hence is that of <hi>David,</hi> (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 31.15.) <hi>My times are in thy hand.</hi> My time of being, and my time of motion, <hi>q. d.</hi> I am one of thy wheels; I, but thou art in this wheel for ſuſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation and ſupport. I cannot be, I cannot act, unleſs thou beeſt as a Wheel in the middle of a Wheel.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, As actual providence brings forth and brings up, ſo it governs: This ſits at the Stern, and Steers the courſe of all inſtruments and ſecon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dary cauſes, and directs them in all their motions unto the deſigned end. Hence it is, that God is called King of Kings, &amp; Lord of Lords, becauſe the government of all things lies upon him; He is not only omnipotent but omniregent; So <hi>Pſal.</hi> 103.19. <hi>His Kingdom ruleth over all.</hi> And therefore we have it in the viſion of the wheels, <hi>verſ.</hi> 18. <hi>That their rings were full of eyes round about.</hi> They were (as one ſaith) <hi>ſtellatae oculis,</hi> bedeckt with eyes, as the heavens with ſtars; and therefore no wonder if they are regular in their motion, in reference to their deſigned end. Nay give me leave to add this, as a thing moſt remarkable; that Divine Providence doth ſo rule in all, and over-rule all
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:62437:101"/>motions and actings, as that the greateſt irregu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larities are made ſubſervient to the higheſt and moſt glorious ends; 'tis true irregular motions cannot be called regular; I, but 'tis as true, that they are improved by the wheel within the wheel for great advantage. Inſomuch that light oft-times ſprings out of darkneſs, and good out of evil. 'Tis true none ought to take encouragement from hence to act irregularly, and to croſs Divine Rule revealed and laid down in the Word; No! at his peril be it, that doth ſo. I but 'tis as true, that as all things work together, ſo they work for good, yea, they terminate at the laſt in the glory of God. God ſerves himſelf by the diſſervices of the creature; yea, experience tells us, that Divine Providence ſometimes takes occaſion from the very ſins &amp; corruption of mans nature to turn men from ſin unto God. That which (in it ſelf is a means of alienation of the heart, is made uſe of as an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument to work it up into communion with God. As good example draws, ſo ſometimes bad example (when out of meaſure bad) ſerves to ſet out the wickedneſs of mans heart (when leſt to it ſelf) &amp; to drive men out of themſelves, and out of a ſtate in nature, yea to bring them into a ſtate of grace. In a word, ſome had never been ſo good, if others had not been extreamly bad. However this I hope none will deny, that Divine provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence moves in the turnings and motions of crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted beings, and makes them inſtrumental to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry on a moſt glorious deſign. How often doth God convince and affect the hearts of ſinners by thoſe Lectures which he reads to them out of the book of the creature? Yea, ſometimes the wheel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:62437:101"/>and turnings about of States and Nations in the world; ſometimes the changes that come upon mens perſons or eſtates are ſtrangely im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved for the change of their hearts. Sometimes an evil feared or felt, a good hoped for or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed; expectation fruſtrated, or hope deferred; comforts multiplied, or turned into croſſes; prayers heard or denyed, are ſanctified and bleſs'd for ſpiritual and ſoul-advantage; yea, there are many men had not been happy, if others had not been miſerable: the fall and ruine of ſome, hath proved the riſe of others. <hi>Oh, the wheel in the middle of a wheel.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus you have heard ſomething of the motion of this divine wheel, I but you do not ſee it. For,</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, This is a myſtery, a very great my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery: for it is <hi>a wheel in the middle of a wheel;</hi> a wheel that no mortal eye ever ſaw, a wheel that the moſt ſublime underſtanding cannot reach, and as the wheel it ſelf is a divine ſecret, hid in the brightneſs of its own glory, ſo is its motion. And therefore ſaith the Pſalmiſt, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 77.19. <hi>Thy way, O God is in the ſea, thy paths in the great wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and thy footſteps are not known.</hi> And again, Pſal. <hi>Thy way is in the Sanctuary.</hi> I, in that San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuary into which none can enter, but the high Prieſt, unleſs the Veil be rent. Hence comes the prophetick Spirit to be of uſe in its time; for had men been able to foreſee the plotting and contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances of divine providence, or to trace it in its workings, the Spirit of Prophecy had not been ſo neceſſary as it was. And therefore God raiſeth up an <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> and by an immediate viſion in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructs him, that he might let the people under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:62437:102"/>their future ſtate and condition; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, 'tis in Gods light that we ſee light. 'Tis true, external wheels are viſible, inſtruments and agents may be ſeen; I, but as the wheel within the wheel is inviſible, ſo are all its workings upon the wheels, untill they are brought off. And therefore is that counſel given, <hi>Prov.</hi> 27.1. <hi>Beaſt not thy ſelf of to morrow, for thou knoweſt not what a day may bring forth.</hi> Time travelleth with divine counſels; and in its ſeaſon brings them forth; I, but little do men know what is in the womb thereof, untill ſhe be delivered.

Now the wayes of God being correſpondent to the thoughts of God, they muſt needs be very dark and myſterious unto us. And hence it is, that men talk ſo much of dark, and complexed providences. Not that there is any daskneſs in them. <hi>Non caeco imp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

When we know not what to think of things, we are apt to dread them; that which is an object of admiration, is ſometimes a cauſe of fear and dread. Hence it is, that ſometimes, thoſe providential
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:62437:102"/>adminiſtrations, that are big with Soul-mer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> wrath and vengeance. Even as Chriſts walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon the Sea towards his Diſciples for their relief and comfort, put them into a pannick fear, becauſe they thought that they had ſeen a Spirit. However, whether this be alwayes the effect or not, yet this is certain, that providential plots and works are very high, very myſterious. We may ſay more truly of God, then we can of any man, that he walks in the clouds; that of the Pſalmiſt, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 18.9. if, full for the purpoſe. <hi>He bowed the heavens and came down, and darkneſs was under his feet.</hi> And again: <hi>He made darkneſs his ſecret place.</hi> For the truth is, nothing of God, or the counſels of God is further known, then he is pleaſed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal. And ſo the Apoſtle argues, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.11. <hi>For what man knoweth the things of a man, ſave the ſpirit of a man which is in him, even ſo, no man know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the things of God, but the ſpirit of God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hence it is that four things fall out frequently.</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>1. Carnal reaſon confuted.</item>
                     <item>2. Carnal confidence and hope diſappointed.</item>
                     <item>3. Unbelief reproved.</item>
                     <item>4. A well grounded faith honoured and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p>Firſt, Carnal reaſon is often confuted by the myſteriouſneſs of providential adminiſtration: for they often tell the rational and wiſe men of the world, that their apprehenſions and aſſertions are a meer <hi>non ſequitur.</hi> And therefore Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.20. Triumphs over them with four ſar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſmal
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:62437:103"/>queſtions. <hi>Where is the Wiſe? Where is the Scribe? Where is the Diſputer of this world? Hath not God made fooliſh the wiſdom of this-world?</hi> Where are they? alas, they are forced to get into an hole, and to hide their heads, as men confounded and amazed; one act of providence ſcatters them, and makes them fly, at leaſt ſtrikes them dead &amp; dumb. They that were continually ſcribling, cannot now write. And they that thought themſelves the only wiſe and knowing men, now ſee that they know nothing. And they that would never be quiet, but would be ready to quarrel with every one they met with, that were of a contrary opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, and ſpake wiſdom among them that are perfect, are now ſilent, for that which they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted reaſon and wiſdom, appears to be folly; and that which they accounted folly, appears to be reaſon and wiſdom. Oh, what a change doth a divine providence work in ſome mens heads, at leaſt, what a check doth it give to ſome mens ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions. And hence is that counſel given by the Lord himſelf to all ſuch men, <hi>Zech.</hi> 2. <hi>ult. Be ſilent, O all fleſh, before the Lord, for he is raiſed out of his holy habitation.</hi> And oh, that men were ſo wiſe as to take this counſel in due time.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Hence it is, that carnal confidence and hope, is often diſappointed. Men ſow the wind, and reap the whirl-wind; expect good, and meet with evil; look for light, and behold darkneſs. So <hi>Mich.</hi> 1.12. <hi>The inhabitants of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roth waited carefully for good, but evil came down from the Lord.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Hence alſo it is, that unbelief is often really reproved. <hi>O fools, and ſlow of heart to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,</hi>
                     <pb n="179" facs="tcp:62437:103"/>is a frequent meſſage that an unbeliever meets with in the very acts of divine providence. Men will not believe that ſuch and ſuch things (though promiſed in the word) can be effected, becauſe they are not able to conceive of the way, nor know the means whereby they ſhall be effect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Turn to 2 <hi>Kings,</hi> 7.1, 2. and there you ſhall find this fully exemplified. For there 'tis ſaid, that when <hi>Eliſha</hi> told the people of <hi>Samaria,</hi> that the famine ſhould be turned into plenty: An atheiſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Lord anſwered, <hi>That if God ſhould make win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows in Heaven might this thing be?</hi> I, but ſee how his Atheiſm and unbelief was reproved. <hi>Behold, thou ſhalt ſee it with thine eyes, but ſhalt not taſte thereof.</hi> And moſt full is that of the Prophet, <hi>Eſ.</hi> 26.11. <hi>Lord, when thy hand is lifted up, they will not ſee. But they ſhall ſee, and be aſhamed.</hi> And indeed, oft times it falleth out thus, that thoſe providences, that do not work to mens conviction and converſion, do work to mens confuſion at the laſt.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly and laſtly, Hence it is, that the faith of believers (bottom'd upon a divine word) is honoured, and confirmed.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. 'Tis honoured, for hereby faith is tried, and holding out is commended. That faith that can truſt God upon a bare word of promiſe, and rely upon unſeen providences, is an honourable faith. And therefore is <hi>Abraham</hi> ſo much commended for his faith, becauſe he followed God in the dark, at a word of command, <hi>And againſt hope believed in hope, that he might become the Father of many Nations, according to that which was ſpoken; ſo ſhall thy ſeed be,</hi> Rom. 4.18. And indeed, as true
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:62437:104"/>faith gives glory to God (as you have it <hi>ver.</hi> 20.) ſo God gives glory unto faith. So you may ſee, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.7. <hi>That the trial of your faith (which is more precious then Gold tried in the fire) may be found unto praiſe, honour and glory, at the appearance of Chriſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. As 'tis honoured, ſo 'tis confirmed. Divine promiſes: give faith its <hi>eſſe,</hi> its being through divine influence, and providential adminiſtrations, gives its <hi>porro eſſe,</hi> a further being. He that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves in God unſeen, will truſt him more upon experience of his fidelity in performing his word. So <hi>Pſal.</hi> 9.10. <hi>They that know thy name, will truſt in thee.</hi> A literal knowledge of God a know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge by report and hear-ſay, may cauſe faith to flutter. I, but a knowledge of God by experience will cauſe it to fly, yea, to towre aloft with ſtrength. Now that I may wind up the Doctri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal part of this divine propoſition. Give me leave to ſay, that, that which doth confute car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal reaſon, diſappoint carnal confidence, reprove unbelief, honour and confirm the faith of Gods elect, muſt needs be a Soul-amazing glory.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Applicat.</hi> 1. Infer. Is it ſo, that the providence of God is like a wheel within a wheel; then this ſpeaks dread and terror to the wicked: for this one wheel within the wheel, counterworks them in all their waies and workings; the wheel with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the wheel, is above all wheels. Take it in Scripture language, in the thing wherein they deal proudly, God is above them, <hi>Exod.</hi> 18.11. The providence of God waits upon all the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, devices and imaginations of Ungodly men, to detect and fruſtrate, yea, to turn them upon their
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:62437:104"/>own heads, to their eternal woe and grief. So ſaith <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 9.16. <hi>The Lord is known by the judgement which he executeth, the wicked is ſnared in the work of his own hands.</hi> Alas, there is no man that plots any evil againſt God, his ordinances, appearances and truths, but puts his feet into a ſnare, out of which, he is not able to extricate himſelf.</p>
                  <p>On ſome, God lets their conſcience looſe to be their own tormentors, with intolerable horrors, and terrors; and ſo he dealt with <hi>Cain.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Sometimes he arms the creatures againſt them, even the leaſt, as well as the greateſt. That trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherous man <hi>Phillips,</hi> who betrayed Mr. <hi>Tindal,</hi> was devoured of Lice.</p>
                  <p>Sometimes God leaves them to themſelves, as the executioners of his divine vengeance; <hi>Judas</hi> went forth, and hang'd himſelf.</p>
                  <p>Nay, ſometimes the immediate hand of God falls upon them and ruines them. When they cry peac, peace to themſelves, then ſudden deſtruction breaks forth upon them. The wheel within the wheel, turns their own counſels and plots upon their own heads.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Infer.</hi> Is it ſo, then this doth adminiſter abundant matter of unſpeakable comfort to the godly. 'Tis a breaſt full of the milk of ſpiritual conſolation, whereat thou mayeſt ſuck, and be abundantly ſatisfied. So you may ſee, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 16.8, 9. <hi>I have ſet the Lord alwayes before me, therefore my heart is glad.</hi> A clear ſight of God in Chriſt is a heart-rejoycing ſight; and ſo to behold God in his adminiſtrations, as the wheel within the wheel, that turns all things about to his own
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:62437:105"/>glory and our eternal good, this is a taking and a comforting object. The word of promiſe is a Chriſtians daily food, and the works of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence are his cordials, and banquets, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with God bears him up, and keeps him from fainting. Many a Soul would fall into a ſwoon, if he were not ſtayed with theſe Apples, and comforted with theſe Flaggons. I ſhall ſay to you, as <hi>Job</hi> to his friends, <hi>Hear diligently, and let this be your conſolations,</hi> Job 21.2. So I ſay, obſerve, conſider, and meditate upon the providences of God, and let them be your conſolation; and that, both in your doing and ſuffering the will of God, whilſt you live here. Let this bear up, ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate, and fortifie your Spirits againſt all fear and diſcouragements, that you meet with in your Chriſtian courſe. When God calls you forth to perform hard, difficult and diſcountenanced du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, call to mind and remember thoſe aſſiſtances which he hath provided in the Covenant of Grace, and exhibited to his ſervants of old, when he hath called them forth to ſuch duties. You know it was an hard and difficult work, for <hi>Joſhua</hi> to ſucceed <hi>Moſes</hi> in the conduct of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> into the Land of <hi>Canaan:</hi> he was not only to meet with much oppoſition from the Inhabitants of <hi>Canaan,</hi> but to conflict with the frowardneſs and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſeneſs of <hi>Iſrael; Joſhua</hi> could not expect better uſage from them, then <hi>Moſes</hi> had had experience of. Yet obſerve how providence did fortifie and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage him, <hi>Joſh.</hi> 1.7 firſt Verſes. And turn to <hi>Hebr.</hi> 13 5. You ſhall find the ſame laid in for all Chriſtians for the future. This may be our conſolation, that God will not leave us nor
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:62437:105"/>forſake us; but be with us for our aſſiſtance, as he was with <hi>Moſes</hi> and with <hi>Joſhua</hi> in their work. How God did manage and aſſiſt his ſervants at all times, in every work whereto he hath called them, Scripture ſpeaks fully and largely; Read <hi>Ezek.</hi> 2.6. <hi>Ezekiel met with briars and thorns; they were with him in his work, and yet ſaith God to him, be not afraid.</hi> What difficulties and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragements did the Apoſtles and ſervants of Chriſt meet with in their diſpenſing the Goſpel all along the primitive times; I, but how mightily were they aſſiſted and carried through all; Read <hi>Act.</hi> 13.45, 46. The more they were oppoſed, the bolde<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> they were. And ſo in reſpect of ſuffering, let the providence of God ſupport and comfort you. I have read this of <hi>Chryſoſtom,</hi> that when <hi>Eudoxia</hi> procured his baniſhment; He ſaid thus, <hi>None of theſe things trouble me, but I ſaid within my ſelf, if the Queen will, let her baniſh me, the earth is the Lords and the fulneſs thereof: if ſhe will, let her ſaw me aſunder,</hi> Iſaiah <hi>ſuffered the ſame: if ſhe will, let her caſt me into the Sea, I will remember</hi> Jonah: <hi>if ſhe will, let her caſt me into a fiery fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace, or amongſt wilde beaſts, the three children and</hi> Daniel <hi>were ſo dealt with: if ſhe will, let her ſtone me, I have</hi> Stephen <hi>and the</hi> Baptiſt <hi>for my bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed companions;</hi> go tell her, <hi>nil niſi peccatum timeo.</hi> Thus ſhould we ſupport and comfort our hearts by the providences of God exerciſed towards others, and eſpecially by the comforts, that others have received from God, in the ſame ſufferings and torments, that we at any time do or may endure. Biſhop <hi>Ridley</hi> writing to <hi>Latimer</hi> in Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:62437:106"/>ſaith, <hi>ever ſince I heard of our dear Brother</hi> Rogers <hi>his ſtout confeſſion, and departing, I never felt any lumpiſh heavineſs in my heart, as ſometimes I did before.</hi> And further, when you hear or read of the providence of God in preventing evil determined by evil inſtruments againſt his Church and people, this ſhould raiſe your ſpirits to a greater pitch of conſolation, and holy courage. And indeed, how many wonders hath God at all times wrought in preſerving and hiding his Saints and people from intended and deſigned plots of miſchief and ruine? is almoſt incredible. I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member what is recorded in the life of <hi>Dionyſius Areopagita;</hi> that when he was cauſed by <hi>Sifinius</hi> the Prefect to be thrown to hungry wilde beaſts, they would not tear him, and into an hot Oven, it would not burn him. The like is reported of S. <hi>Ambroſe;</hi> for a certain wizard ſent his ſpirits to kill him, but they returned anſwer, that God had hedg'd him in as he did <hi>Job:</hi> another came with a ſword to his bed ſide to have killed him, but he could not ſtir his hand, until, repenting, he was reſtored, by the prayer of S. <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> to the uſe of his hands again. So the <hi>Circumcellians,</hi> being not able to withſtand S. <hi>Auſtins</hi> preaching and writing, ſought his deſtruction, having beſet the way, wherein he was to go his viſitation; but by Gods Providence he miſſing his way, eſcaped the danger. And one ſaith of <hi>Luther,</hi> That <hi>Luther</hi> a poor Frier ſhould be able to ſtand againſt the Pope was a miracle: that he ſhould prevail againſt the Pope was a greater: and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter all to die in peace, having ſo many ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:62437:106"/>was the greateſt of all. When this was repreſented unto <hi>Moſes</hi> in a type, it did much affect his heart. Oh, ſaith he, I will turn aſide and ſee this great ſight.<note place="margin">

                        </gap>.2, 3, 4.</note> It was a great and glorious ſight to ſee the buſh in the fire not conſumed: but more to ſee the Church under great perſecution, and yet not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed: the people of God maligned and oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and yet to live: this is a miracle, a ſoul comforting providence. But oh then, what a ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſing comfort, doth the conſideration of Gods improving providences, afford to the Saints? thoſe providences (I mean) whereby he doth extract the beſt good out of the worſt evil; So that the ſoul may ſay as S. <hi>Paul</hi> of a great evil; <hi>I know that this ſhall turn to my ſalvation. Phil.</hi> 1.19. <hi>And therefore I rejoyce.</hi> So 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.9, 10. <hi>Moſt gladly therefore will I rather glory in mine infirmities.</hi> And again, <hi>Therefore I take pleaſure in infirmities, in reproaches, in neceſſities, in perſecutions, in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſes for Chriſts ſake, for when I am weak then am I ſtrong.</hi> S. <hi>Pauls</hi> weakneſs was converted into ſtrength; he never was ſo ſtrong in the inward man, as when he was weakeſt in the outward; and herein he rejoyced. God doth ever bring a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout ſome glorious deſign (as it were) at a back door, and a contrary way; that the wrath of man ſhall praiſe God. And doth not this ſpeak comfort, and courage to the people of God in all their dark and cloudy fits? ſurely it doth; and that which kills the hearts of others, may be the greateſt reviver of their hearts; For their greateſt ſorrows, ſhall turn to their greateſt joy; and their extremity of miſeries, ſhall prove their higheſt
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:62437:107"/>glories; their Winter, ſhall bring forth a flouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Spring; and their mournful Seed-time, a moſt plentiful Harveſt. And therefore, let me exhort you in the words of the holy Apoſtle, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.12. <hi>Lift up the hands which hang down, and the feeble knees.</hi> Be not diſmayed or diſcouraged at any thing that falleth out: For know, that there is a wheel within a wheel, that worketh and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth in all things; yea, that ordereth and diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth them ſo, that not one iota or tittle of Gods counſel ſhall fail of accompliſhment. <hi>Melancthon</hi> knowing the rage of the Papiſts, and <hi>Ceſar</hi>'s threats, was much troubled, and gave himſelf wholly up to grief, ſighs and tears: Whereupon, <hi>Luther</hi> writes to him thus, <hi>I extreamly diſlike your exceſſive cares, with which you ſay, you are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt conſumed: If the cauſe be bad, let us revoke it, and fly back: If it be good, why do we not truſt God in his promiſes? If Chriſt be the Conquerour of the World, why ſhould we fear it, as if it would over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come us?</hi> As for <hi>Luther</hi> himſelf, he had an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daunted Spirit: For when our King <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth, had written bitterly againſt him; He makes this Anſwer, <hi>Let the</hi> Henries, <hi>the Biſhops, the Turk, and the Devil himſelf do what they can, we are the Children of the Kingdom, worſhipping and waiting for that Saviour, whom they, and ſuch as they, ſpit upon and crucifie.</hi> The truth is, there is no condition whereunto the Church of God in general, or any Chriſtian in particular can fall, but they may hold up their heads, and lift up their hearts, to an high pitch of conſolation therein; if they do but lay the providence of God to heart, and conſider how that works in all, to bring about
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:62437:107"/>the will of God. They may ſay, as <hi>Shecaniah</hi> ſaid to <hi>Ezra, There is yet hope in Iſrael concerning this thing.</hi> And as <hi>Mordecai</hi> to <hi>Heſter, Comfort and deliverance ſhall come.</hi> And as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> in the temptation God will make a way for an eſcape. <hi>He hath delivered, he doth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver, and in him we truſt, that he will deliver.</hi> What though Satan, and all the confederates of darkneſs, were now at work to deſtroy one Soul, and to pluck it out of the hand of Chriſt; yet providence will preſerve it. What though Antichriſt, and his adherents are combining and plotting againſt Chriſt and his members, his truths and ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; yet providence will over-ſhadow them. And Beloved, if every Errour in the Nation were an hundred, and every Heretick a thouſand; yet truth, and the profeſſors thereof ſhall prevail, <hi>Acts</hi> 5.38.

                     <hi>Eſ.</hi> 63.5. We may take up the words of the Prophet <hi>Habakkuk.</hi> Chap. 3.17. <hi>Although the fig-tree ſhall not bloſſom, neither ſhall fruit be in the vines, the labour of the olive ſhall fail, and the fields ſhall yield no meat, the flock ſhall be cup off from the fold, and there ſhall be no herd in the ſtalls: yet I will rejoyce in the Lord: I will joy in the God of my ſalvation.</hi> 'Tis all one with God, to work with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out means as by means, and 'tis not out of any neceſſity, but to magnifie the riches of his wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, power, and bounty, that he doth make uſe of any: and therefore, when God comes down from the hills into the valley, we ſhould not fear, nor be deſpondent. Yea, whatever the ſubject be whereon he works, though never ſo dead and dry, he can form it according to his own mind and will; dead and drie bones he can cauſe to live: As you may ſee, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 37. <hi>begin.</hi> Rocks ſhall flow with water, the Sea ſhall give way for Iſraels paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage, the Ravens ſhall turn Caterers and Cooks, <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Sarah</hi> ſhall grow young again, and be fertile; nay, the very heath, and barren wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs ſhall become fruitful, and pleaſant places to dwell in. In a word, God doth whatever he pleaſeth; his hand is no way ſhortened or weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened by working: And therefore he is pleaſed to make daily repetitions of his old wonders, that the people of God may have full and ſtrong con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation.</p>

And yet beſides all theſe, let me tell you, that you live upon the wonders of divine providence; 'tis a wonder, that ſinners live on this ſide Hell, and enjoy ſo many forfeited mercies and comforts, as you do enjoy. And therefore you may well take up the the words of the holy Apoſtle; ſeeing all theſe things are thus, <hi>What manner of perſons ought we to be.</hi> For I tell you, that a common life is no way ſuitable to Gods admirable diſpenſations: No, God ſaith to all ſuch, as our Saviour did once to his Diſciples, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.47. <hi>What do you more then others?</hi> For 'tis not enough for you that live by, and under the turnings of this divine wheel, to be good in the general; but you muſt labour to be excellent. Every motion of this wheel, is a new engagement upon your Spirits; take a few directions herein: For an admirable life lies chiefly in a conformity to the life of God; no life is admirable, but the life of God, and our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity thereunto. And hence it is, that the life of God, is ſet up as our pattern of imitation, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.44, 45, 48. <hi>But I ſay unto you, love your enemies, bleſs them that curſe you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpitefully
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:62437:109"/>uſe you, and perſecute you: that ye may be the children of your father which is in heaven: for he maketh his Sun to riſe on the evil and on the good, and ſendeth rain on the juſt and on the unjuſt. Be ye therefore perfect, even as your father which is in heaven is perfect.</hi> The Child is but the Father multiplied, 'tis Man in a new edition: And ſo he that lives the life of God, is nothig elſe then a new edition, and a new copy of the image of God. Holineſs in life and power, is the image of God drawn upon the heart, and life of man. Saints are living pictures of their heavenly father; they are Gods looking-glaſſes, wherein he loves to view his own excellency and glory. Hence it is, that they are ſaid to be near to him; and that he taketh pleaſure in them, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 148. <hi>ult.</hi> 149.4. As women will have their glaſſes before their eye, and take pleaſure in a true glaſs, that gives a true reflex of their beauty. So Saints are a people near to God, and God delights in them; as they are in Chriſt, ſo he loved them: but as he lives in them, ſo he delights in them. Now that which is Gods de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, is the moſt admirable, and may well be our wonder. Nothing ſhould take up our hearts, thoughts, time and ſtrength, ſo much as the life of God: All other things ſhould be of little force to take up our hearts; But take heed, leſt a form of godlineſs keep you from the life of God. Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion is now in faſhion, and every one (almoſt) makes ſome outward ſhew; I, but few do live the life of God.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. In high and moſt eminent deſigns for God: He that knows God to be all in all, muſt be all for God. Moſt ſull is that of <hi>Paul, Phil.</hi> 1.21. <hi>To me to live
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:62437:109"/>is Chriſt.</hi> i.e. All my deſigns are for Chriſt; for the advancing his deſigns in the world; that he may be all, and have all ſubjected unto him. A Chriſtian ſhould do nothing, but plot and deſign for Chriſt; he ſhould be of a publick active Spirit, and lay out himſelf, and his abilities to the utmoſt for God. 'Tis recorded of <hi>Levi,</hi> that he knew neither Father nor Mother. And <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>That henceforth, we know no man after the fleſh:</hi> We ſhould be wholly for God. A Chriſtian ſhould not know ſuch a thing as Self, in his deſigns and aims; ſelf-intereſts, ſelf-glory, ſelf-comfort, and all ſhould be thrown down at the foot of God. All external wheels, are but inſtruments acted by this internal wheel, and ordered and diſpoſed of ſo, as that this may have the glory of all. Shall the Ax boaſt it ſelf againſt him that heweth there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, or the Saw magnifie it ſelf againſt him that ſhaketh it? <hi>Eſ.</hi> 10.15. Nothing more improper and abſurd. Oh Beloved, take heed of carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on ſelf-deſigns, under a pretence of acting for God. Wicked men will do ſo; but you muſt go beyond them: You muſt do more then they can do.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. In living by faith upon God; 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.7. <hi>We live by faith and not by ſight.</hi> A Chriſtian ought not to hang by the eye-lids, eying and look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at external wheels, and ſecond cauſes only; but to exerciſe faith upon the wheel within the wheel. This is that which muſt actuate and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liven all ſecond cauſes, or elſe they cannot work. What is it that thou doſt deſire? this muſt bring it to paſs; <hi>Not by might, nor by power, but by my Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,</hi> Zech. 4.6. Would'ſt thou have thy corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:62437:110"/>mortified, thy temptation conquered, thy graces ſtrengthened, thy comforts enlarged, thy fears prevented, thy prayers heard; reſt not upon the external wheels, but upon the wheel within the wheel. Means muſt be uſed, but not truſted in; God alone is the object of a Chriſtians faith. Say therefore, <hi>In vain is ſalvation hoped for from the multitude of hills and mountains: but in the Lord our God is ſalvation,</hi> Jer. 3.23. And let it be ſaid of you, as it is of <hi>Abraham, Ro.</hi> 4.18, 19. <hi>Who againſt hope, believed in hope.</hi> When all inſtruments are dead, Ordinances dead, Comforts dead, Graces dead, heart even dead; yet give glory to God by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving in him, who never dies. And for this end, follow the example of the Prophet, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 77.10, 11, 12. <hi>I will remember the years of the right hand of the moſt high. I will remember the works of the Lord: ſurely I will remember thy wonders of old. I will meditate alſo of all thy work, and talk of thy doings.</hi> Yea, wouldſt thou ſet this internal wheel, on work, wouldſt thou move that? Why then, ſet faith on work, this is that whereby divine providence ſuffers it ſelf to be moved. How came <hi>Abraham</hi> to be the Father of many Nations? but by the movings of this internal wheel; and what ſet that a going, but the faith of <hi>Abraham:</hi> And therefore it is ſaid, that he believed in hope, that he might become the Father of many Nations. Beloved, if ever you would ſet any inſtrument, or inferiour wheel on work, you muſt move the greater wheel: So it is here, 'tis God that muſt move, and you muſt ſet God on work by faith. An active faith will not let God alone; it gives him no reſt, untill he hath ſet all ſecond cauſes
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:62437:110"/>on work, and accompliſhed the deſired mercy. Now in this, you go beyond all moral men; they may make uſe of means: I, but they can't believe; they can't ſet the great wheel on work.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. In fixing your hearts upon things that are above. Let the conſtant openings of your Souls be for the entertainment of Heavenly enjoyments. And this is a wonder, <hi>Rev.</hi> 12.1. A Chriſtians heart ſhould be in Heaven, and the world under his feet. The Earth is Gods, and a good mans foot-ſtool; thou mayeſt walk upon it, but not be buried in it. Moſt excellent is the Apoſtles Rule, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.29, 30, 31. <hi>But this I ſay, Brethren, the time is ſhort. It remaineth, that both they that have wives, be as though they had none; and they that weep, as though they wept not; and they that rejoice, as though they rejoiced not; and they that buy, as though they poſſeſſed not; and they that uſe this world, as not abuſing it: for the faſhion of this world paſſeth away.</hi> And this was the Apoſtles glory, that the world was crucified unto him, and he unto the world, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.14. He looks upon all, as ſo many dead corps and carkaſes.</p>
                  <p>Fourth and laſt Inference, If this divine wheel be ſo admirable and glorious, then this teacheth you to maintain a conſtant communion with it. For you are little wheels; I, but what will you do, if this divine wheel, be not as a wheel in the middle of a wheel; what ſhall act and move you in order to your comfortable winding up: Sure I am, you will be like <hi>Sampſon,</hi> when his Lock was cut off. Your ſtrength is departed from you, and you like Inſtruments laid aſide, and of no uſe. I, but if God be in you, and with
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:62437:111"/>you, then you ſhall go forth in the ſtrength of an omnipotent power, and be admirable in working, yea, you ſhall have cauſe to admire the wheel within the wheel, and ſing with <hi>Moſes, Who is a God like our God, glorious in holineſs, fearful in praiſes, doing wonders.</hi> Yea, with the heavenly Quire, ſaying, <hi>Amen, bleſſing and glory, wiſdom and thankſgiving, and honour, and power, and might be unto our God for ever and ever.</hi> Amen.</p>

For,
<list>
                        <item>1. Here is a Priſoner in liberty.</item>
                        <item>2. A Judge in bonds.</item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>Saint <hi>Paul</hi> the Priſoner, and <hi>Felix</hi> the Judge; the one we meet with in the entrance into the Text, the other in the cloſe; and both afford us matter of admiration.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, The liberty of St. <hi>Paul</hi> the Priſoner; for here we find him at liberty to preach, and preaching with liberty.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. At liberty to preach: That an Apoſtle
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:62437:113"/>ſhould be a Priſoner, is much; but that he, who was impriſoned upon the account of preaching, ſhould have liberty (whilſt a Priſoner) to preach, and that before his Judge, this is more. Not many daies before, he was accuſed by a famous Oratour, and libell'd againſt with a deep charge of high miſdemeanours, and capital crimes, and that with ſo much artifice and ſubtilty, that it is a wonder, that a ſentence of death had not paſſed upon him, according to the malevolent expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his malicious enemies; and he for ever de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of his liberty to preach any more; and yet, to ſpeak in the <hi>Ciceronian</hi> Dialect, <hi>Vivit, imo vivit, &amp; in Senatum venit.</hi> He lives, yea, he lives to preach: And that</p>
                  <p n="2">2. With liberty; I, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, with much liberty and boldneſs: For neither the gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deur of the Auditor, nor the experience that he had of a former durance, no, nor his fear of fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, had any ſuch influence upon him; as to ſeal up his lips, or tempt him to play the Sycophant, or flattering Courtier, that thereby he might have gained an enlargement of his preſent liberty: No! but in ſtead thereof, he levels a piercing, and a wounding arrow at his breaſt, and reaſoned of ſuch things, as he knew were wanting in him: For the Text tells us, that <hi>he reaſoned of righteouſneſs and temperance.</hi> And where is the man almoſt in the Apoſtles caſe, that dare preach ſuch things before ſuch an Auditor? the more is Saint <hi>Paul</hi> to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired, for his boldneſs and liberty in preaching, and reaſoning before <hi>Felix.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This is the firſt Paradox.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Here is a Judge in bonds; for as the
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:62437:113"/>Apoſtles reaſoning, argues his liberty; ſo the Judge his trembling, argues his bondage; and ſo 'tis ſaid int he Text, <hi>Felix trembled.</hi> For this is certain, that there are no ſuch pinching, and ſoul-tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting bonds, as legal and ſervile fear puts upon, and binds the Soul with. 'Tis ſaid of <hi>Joſeph,</hi> that the irons entered into his Soul: I, but none go ſo deep, nor wound ſo much, as the bonds and irons of ſervile fear; I, but is not this a paradox, that he, that had the power of civil binding, and looſing others, ſhould be put into bonds, and that by his Priſoner? I ſay, do not theſe things ſeem ſtrange, are they not knots hard to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tied? Why, ſurely they are; and therefore I ſhall take the aſſiſtance of three hands, to untie them.</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>1. <hi>Manus authoritatis,</hi> The Priſoners call.</item>
                     <item>2. <hi>Manus integritatis,</hi> The Priſoners integrity.</item>
                     <item>3. <hi>Manus reatus,</hi> The Judges guilt.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p>Firſt, The Preachers Call, gave him liberty to preach before his Judge? 'Tis true, <hi>quod officium,</hi> he had his authority from God, but <hi>quod exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tium officii,</hi> he received authority from man; For ſo it is ſtoried, <hi>ver.</hi> 24. that <hi>Felix</hi> ſent for him; and who might better open the door, then he that ſhut it? And when was the time for the Apoſtle to enter, but when the door was opened? 'Tis true, he took no more liberty, then was given; but, what was given, that he took; elſe, he might have been check'd with ingratitude to the Judge, (who gave him a call, to preach at this time) and alſo, with unfaithfulneſs to his Lord and Maſter, who gave him his grand and Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolical Commiſſion; and thus the knot begins to be unlooſed, and the wonder to ceaſe. And
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:62437:114"/>therefore give me leave, to make uſe of a ſecond hand; And that is,</p>
                  <p>Secondly, The Preachers integrity; for this gave him liberty and boldneſs in preaching: 'Tis true, <hi>Si ſat accuſatio, quis innocens?</hi> If to accuſe were ſufficient, the Preacher had been guilty, &amp; the Judge might well have retorted, <hi>a turpe eſt doctori.</hi> But whoever reads his defence, in ſome preceding Verſes, ſhall find him to keep his ground, and hold faſt the ſenſe of his integrity, although his enemies hoped, to have given him a rout. Now, as the old Proverb hath it, <hi>bonae cauſae ſpem ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſſe comitem.</hi> I ſhall only add, <hi>bonae conſcientiae,</hi> to make it full and clear. A good cauſe and a good conſcience, teacheth confidence and boldneſs; and you have a better warrant for it, <hi>Prov.</hi> 28.1. <hi>The righteous is as bold as a Lion.</hi> And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, that Miniſter of the Goſpel, that doth <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, may boldly, and freely <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>. He that lives the life of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> may couragiouſly preach the Doctrine of St. <hi>Paul.</hi> He that is righteous and temperate, may with confidence, and without a bluſh, reaſon of Righteouſneſs and Temperance, unleſs he be frown'd into a meal-mouth'd baſeneſs, by his Auditors. And 'tis as true, that had the life of the Auditor in the Text, been conſimilar, and proportioned to the life of the Preacher, he might have ſate out the Sermon, with as much comfort, as it was preached with confidence: For <hi>hic murus ahencus, nil conſcire ſibi.</hi> But as none wrangle againſt the truth, but the erroneous; ſo none dread it, but the guilty; and this leads me to the third hand.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, The Judges guilt; for if <hi>Joſephus,</hi>
                     <pb n="201" facs="tcp:62437:114"/>and <hi>Tacitus,</hi> may be believed in their Reports, he was notoriouſly guilty; but we need go no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, for a proof thereof, then his carriage towards the Preacher, and the naming of his Wife <hi>Druſilla:</hi> for her, by enticements and magical arts, he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lured to himſelf from her Husband; and him he detained Priſoner two years unjuſtly, becauſe he would not give him a Bribe: And therefore no wonder, that as the Priſoner reaſoned, the Judge trembled. And thus you ſee, there is a wonder, and no wonder; or the knot, and difficulty that lay before us, untied, that we may conſider the words of the Text, as they lie naked before us; and therein you have three Conſiderables.</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>1. <hi>Modus concionandi,</hi> The manner of the Apoſtles treating his Auditor.</item>
                     <item>2. <hi>Subjecta materia concionis,</hi> The ſubject mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of his Sermon.</item>
                     <item>3. <hi>Effectus utriuſque,</hi> The effect of both.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p>The manner was convictive, <hi>He reaſoned.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The matter was ſubſtantial, ſumm'd up in three Topicks; <hi>Righteouſneſs, Temperance, and Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to come.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The effect was glorious; for as the Apoſtle rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned of the Topicks, <hi>Felix trembled.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>All very conſiderable. For,</p>
                  <p>The manner ſerves for a Goſpel-Miniſters imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation. The matter ſerves for all mens informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And the effect gives us a ground of expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that miniſters ſo reaſoning, as the Apoſtle did, and preaching ſuch matter, as he preached, may (through divine influence) meet with the like ſucceſs of their labours. And,</p>
                  <p>Upon this account, have I choſen the Text, and
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:62437:115"/>of theſe things, I ſhall take liberty, to reaſon at this time.</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>1. By way of explication, as to part.</item>

                  </list>
                  <p>Fiſt, by way of explication. And the</p>

                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>. For I find it variouſly rendred; ſometimes to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe or confer, contend and diſpute; but in the Text, to reaſon, and to argue: For that is the moſt convictive way of preaching, or teaching; and, ſo conſtantly uſed by the Apoſtle, that he tells the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.2. <hi>That his preaching was not with enticing words of mans wiſdom: but, in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration of the ſpirit.</hi> Not (I bumbly conceive) as ſome would have it, and do aſſert it, by working of miracles, as if the Apoſtles ſucceſs of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry, flowed only from that. But (as a learned An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>notator ſaith) with demonſtrations, fetch'd out of the very marrow of the Scriptures. 'Tis very true, Miracles ſerved much, to evince the truth of the Goſpel, and to beget an head conviction in many, that were ſpectators thereof: but demonſtrations drawn from the letter of the Goſpel, was the <hi>vehi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culum ſpiritus ſancti;</hi> the medium of divine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence, to beget an heart-conviction: For, no ſword will pierce the ſpirit of man; but the ſword of the Spirit, the Word of God. And therefore ſaith the Apoſtle, 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.7. <hi>We have this treaſure in earthen veſſels,</hi>

No! but matter of an univerſal concern; for it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns all, both ſuperiours, and inferiours, inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent and guilty, to be inſtructed in theſe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picks, righteouſneſs, temperance, and judgement to come. The two firſt relate to man, and the third to God. 'Tis mans duty to be righteous, and temperate; and Gods Prerogative to judge; The two firſt are two Cardinal vertues, and the third imports a judiciary trial of men thereby, at a time fixt in Divine minds; men muſt be vertuous, for they ſhall be judged. There is a time given to men to exerciſe vertue, and that is the time pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent; and there is a time, for men to be judged by the rule of vertue, but that is to come. S. <hi>Paul</hi> reaſons of both, and ſo ſhall I. Firſt, Of the Cardinal vertues inſtanc'd in; and herein, I cannot but obſerve the Apoſtles imitation of a Maſter Builder, that having laid a good foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, <hi>ad ſolidum &amp; in ſolido,</hi> leaves it not na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, but erects the ſuperſtructure proportionate thereunto; For having preſented his auditour with the ſumme of the Goſpel, in preaching faith in Chriſt to him (that he might not appear a <hi>Soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidean</hi> or <hi>Antinomian</hi>) he reaſoneth of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and temperance, which are the proper and genuine ſuperſtructure, upon that moſt choice and excellent foundation; For though faith in Chriſt alone juſtifies in a figurative ſenſe, yet that faith, that juſtifies, is not alone; For as faith in Chriſt juſtifies the perſon, ſo vertue juſtifies faith, and ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:62437:116"/>it to be of a Divine Stamp, even the faith of Gods elect. Faith, without works, is dead, and works, without faith, do not pleaſe him, whom, above all, we ought to ſtudy to pleaſe. Well therefore, did the Apoſtle, as it became an Apoſtle, to build the ſilver, gold, and pretious ſtones of righteouſneſs and temperance, upon the glorious, and precious foundation of faith in Chriſt; for righteouſneſs imparted, is a moſt ſuitable ſtructure to righteouſneſs imputed, and renders the whole fabrique uniform, and beautiful; the coſt indeed is Gods, but the beauty is mans. And therefore the moraliſt (in dreſſing up his moral Lady) ſaith, that her head is wiſdom, her eyes pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, her heart love her ſpirits charity, her thighs juſtice, her health temperance, and fortitude her ſtrength; For that perſon, that is endowed with theſe vertues, is a lovely and beautiful perſon, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he hath no other ornament upon him; Nay I hope, without offence to Ladies, I may call him a beauty; Others may be as beautiful as <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalon,</hi> as fair as <hi>Aleibiades</hi> in their bodies without; and yet have <hi>corpora turpiſſima interne,</hi> as was ſaid of the laſt; foul and deformed ſouls. Yea, may juſtly be accounted <hi>Reipublicae morbi,</hi> the botches of the Commonwealth. Alaſs, with many, to be religious, juſt, and temperate, is too mean, too baſe, in their eſteem: in their eye, vertue is the vice, and vice the vertue; <hi>pudebat me non fuiſſe impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentem</hi> (as S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> hath it in his confeſſions) may be written upon the foreheads of ſome per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and none of the inferiour ſort. For they do not only reſiſt the impreſſions of grace, but trace the ſtamp of nature and hope, with <hi>Heroſtratus,</hi>
                     <pb n="205" facs="tcp:62437:116"/>to be memorable for villany. But I muſt not be excurſive, being confined to an Apoſtolical me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod, and to an inch of time, in my reaſoning hereof. And therefore, once more I crave your leave, that I may reaſon of righteouſneſs and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance apart, as the Apoſtle did. And,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Of righteouſneſs; and herein (not to trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble you with the various definitions, and deſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons thereof, laid down in ſundry Authors) I ſhall take the liberty, to give you this deſcription of it, that it is an exact conformity unto law, in our dealings with others, according to the ſphear wherein God hath ſet us.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, I ſay, it is an exact conformity unto law, in our actings towards, and dealings with others; And therefore, ſome will have the Latine word, to derive its pedigree from a word, in that language, that ſignifies Law; and ſay, <hi>juſtitia habet nomen a jure;</hi> for this is an undoubted rule, <hi>id tantum poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumus, quod jure poſſumus;</hi> that, and that onely is juſt, which is juſtifiable by Law, either Humane or Divine; either Literal or Aequipollent. 'Tis very true, a diſcourſe of Law, becomes <hi>Weſtminſter Hall,</hi> or an Inn of Court, better then Gods Sanctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary: and yet I hope, a Goſpel Miniſter may take liberty to preſs all men to make Law their Rule; I, and the Law of man, as far as it is conform to the Law of God. For I may ſay, of that as <hi>Tertullus</hi> of <hi>Felix; By that we enjoy great quietneſs in our rights and poſſeſſions.</hi> But,</p>
                  <p>Secondly, This is not all; for righteouſneſs is an exact conformity to Law in the ſphear and place wherein God hath ſet us; for that is a righteous act, when performed by one; which is unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:62437:117"/>when done by another: And therefore if St. <hi>Peter</hi> draws his ſword, (though in defence of his Maſter) and cuts of <hi>Malcus</hi> his ear, he receives no better reward, then a ſharp rebuke from his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, the King of righteouſneſs, and Prince of peace. And if <hi>David</hi> cuts off the lap of <hi>Sauls</hi> Garment, his heart ſmites him for it. 'Tis true, a national reformation may be very neceſſary, at ſome times, and in ſome caſes; but not to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken by private perſons, <hi>Renuente Magiſtratus,</hi> againſt the expreſs and declared will of the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream Magiſtrate. And hence ariſeth that common diſtribution of Juſtice, into <hi>diſtributative &amp; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutative.</hi> The firſt whereof refers to the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate, and the other to the Privateer.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. I ſay, Diſtributative Juſtice belongs to the Magiſtrate, <hi>qua Magiſtrate;</hi> for he properly, and principally is <gap reason="foreign">

And the,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Rule that I ſhall lay down is this, that juſtice muſt be done <hi>cito,</hi> ſpeedily, and you have an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs for it, (<hi>Ezra</hi> 7.26.) which (though it came from an heathen King, yet) 'tis approved of by the Holy-ghoſt; 'tis this, <hi>Whoſoever will not do the Law of God, and the Law of the King,</hi> (for theſe muſt not claſh.) Let judgement be executed ſpeedily upon him; and yet give me leave to tell you, that <hi>Veſpaſians</hi> motto upon his Coyn, will do very well in the caſe, <hi>Sat cito, ſi ſat bene,</hi> That is ſoon enough, that is well enough. And therefore,</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Take this rule alſo, that juſtice muſt be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuted <hi>prudenter;</hi> with judgement and diſcretion. 'Tis eaſie to cut a knot, but hard to unty it; and therefore Magiſtrates muſt be Seers, as well as Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, or elſe they will not be Miniſters to the
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:62437:118"/>Subjects for good; And indeed, upon this account, they are called heads of the people. I, but what is an head, without an eye? and if the eye be dark how great is that darkneſs? And therefore, ſaith one, blind Miniſters are the Peſt of the Church, and blind Magiſtrates are the Peſt of Kingdoms; and yet give me leave to tell you; That theſe eyes muſt not be covered, nor blinded. And therefore ſaith <hi>Solomon, Prov.</hi> 25.2. <hi>'Tis the glory of God, to conceal a thing: but the honour of Kings to ſearch out a matter, i. e.</hi> It concerns all, that are intruſted with the execution of juſtice, to ſearch out the matter. I, but <hi>hic labor hoc opus eſt;</hi> they muſt exerciſe patience, and prudence herein; or elſe ſhoot at rovers, and wound where they ſhould apply a healing balſom; or elſe be Phyſitians of no value, in giving a Cordial, inſtead of a Purge or Corroſive; They muſt, therefore, have an Eagles eye, as well as a Ladies hand; that they may hit the diſtemper; Protection to whom Protection is due, puniſhment to whom puniſhment is due. Let not one have that portion of juſtice, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to another;<note place="margin">

                     </note> And therefore as one word in the Hebrew Language ſignifies an ear, and a pair of ballances, ſo the ear of all thoſe, that are entruſted with the execution of ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, ſhould be as a pair of ballances, firſt to weigh things, and then to determine. Let not him that ſits upon the Bench be a Merchant to carry the ballances of deceit about him, and ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice will be duly adminiſtred; When <hi>res cum re, cauſa cum cauſa, ratio cum ratione concertet.</hi> When many words of a different complexion, are dropt into a Judges, or a Juſtices ears, then is the time
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:62437:118"/>for them to weigh, and conſider things wiſely, before they give out their ſentence; and that made much for the commendation of <hi>Philip,</hi> that he always kept an ear open for the Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Juſtice muſt be executed <hi>univerſaliter,</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partially, without reſpect of perſons; And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the common Emblem of Juſtice is drawn with covered eyes; to intimate, that, though a Magiſtrate ſhould not be blind as to cauſes, yet, as to perſons he ſhould. Nay, in this reſpect Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates ſhould be no men of this world, but like the Angels in heaven, who know no ſuch thing as a relation or a friend; And ſay with the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, (2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.16.) <hi>We know no man after the fleſh;</hi> friend and foe, rich and poor, old and young, muſt have juſtice done them; And ſo the Law of God requires, <hi>Levit.</hi> 19.15. <hi>Thou ſhalt not reſpect the perſon of the poor, nor honour the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the mighty.</hi> And again, <hi>Exod.</hi> 23.3. <hi>Thou ſhalt not countenance a poor man in his cauſe, i. e.</hi> If his cauſe be unjuſt; the rich muſt not be inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that the poor may be countenanced; For Magiſtrates are not called to do acts of Charity, but acts of Juſtice. God himſelf cannot endure, that any one ſhould be wronged under a pretence of doing him right; And therefore ſaith, (<hi>Eſay</hi> 61.8.) <hi>I the Lord love judgement, I hate robbery for burnt offerings.</hi> Now if we may not unjuſtly take from men, to give to God; certainly, we may not take from man, to give to man; no! not from a foe, to give to a friend; not from the rich, to give to the poor, nor from the poor, to give to the rich; but as the Law was made, ſo it
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:62437:119"/>ſhould be put in execution, without reſpect of perſons; not rendered like <hi>Tardalus</hi> his web, wickets for ſome, and ſnares for others; an unlike judgement muſt not be given to thoſe that are alike, nor alike judgement given to thoſe that are unlike in point of offence. A Magiſtrate muſt not weigh the big looks of the ſons of <hi>Anake,</hi> nor make any difference in civil, or criminal cauſes, betwixt the mighty <hi>Nimrods</hi> of the nation, that declare their ſin as <hi>Sodom,</hi> and the cowardly lurchers, that dare not ſhew their faces; A power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful oppreſſour, a valiant Dueller, a gallant high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way-man, and a mad Hector, ſhould receive no more favour from the Sword of Juſtice, than a ſneaking Cut-purſe.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Juſtice ſhould be adminiſtred <hi>gratis,</hi> not for filthy lucre ſake, but for juſtice ſake; and that upon the account of a Sacred, and Divine Statute, <hi>Deut.</hi> 16.19. <hi>Thou ſhalt not reſpect per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, neither take a gift; for a gift doth blind the eyes of the wiſe, and prevent the words of the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous;</hi> and indeed experience tells us, that if a man hath the eye of an Eagle, a moſt piercing eye, yet a gift, a bribe, like a vail or covering, muffles him up in darkneſs, that he cannot diſcern a difference in things, or cauſes; and hence it is, that ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, not he that hath the beſt cauſe, but the beſt purſe carries the day; a bad cauſe is good weight, and a good cauſe found too light to paſs; or to ſpeak in the Language of one of the Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents; <hi>auro loquente,</hi>

However, this I am certain of, that there is a ſad complaint, in many places of the Nation; that either Juſtice is not adminiſtred, <hi>ſat cite,</hi> not ſoon enough, or not <hi>ſat bone,</hi> not well enough. And truly, when I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider mens boldneſs, and impudence in their lewd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, I am ſomewhat jealous, that there is ſome reaſon, or ground for the complaint: For men ſwear, and drink, and whore, and commit all manner of wickedneſs, as if they had received a a Law, to do ſuch things.

<pb n="212" facs="tcp:62437:120"/>oh, that that golden rule were written upon your hearts, and made legible in your lives, which <hi>Severus</hi> the Emperour, was ſo taken with, that he cauſed it to be written in his Pallace, and elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where; 'tis this, <hi>Quod tibi fieri non vis, alteri ne feceris;</hi> What you would not have others do to you, do not you that to them; and the rather, becauſe it was delivered by our Saviour, and ſtands upon record, in the affirmative, <hi>Mat.</hi> 7.12. The extent whereof is this, That what we would have other men to think, ſpeak, and do to us, with a rectified will, that we muſt think, ſpeak, and do to them, and no worſe. Wouldſt thou have good weight, and full meaſure in buying? why, thou muſt give the ſame in ſelling. Wouldſt thou have another faithful, in a truſt committed to him, by thy ſelf? why, that alſo may be juſtly expected from thee, when ever thou art truſted. Wouldſt thou have another keep his word with thee? why, thou muſt be as careful to keep thine with others. Art thou unwilling, that others ſhould wound thy name, blaſt thy credit, by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches, or bearing falſe witneſs againſt thee? why, then take heed of doing that to others; and give me leave to tell you, that were this Rule obſerved, our Vine would not be as the Vine of <hi>Sodom,</hi> nor our Grapes, the Grapes of Gall. Judgement would not ſpring up as Hemlock in the furrows of the field, nor righteouſneſs be turned into wormwood, but we ſhould be the habitation of righteouſneſs, and the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of holineſs; and yet, if any of you think this Rule too general, or too narrow, for you to walk by, take ſome other that may convey a

That in <hi>Levit.</hi> 19.35, 36. <hi>Ye ſhall do no unrighteouſneſs in judgement, in mete yard, in weight, or in meaſure, juſt ballances, juſt weights, a juſt epha, and a juſt bin, ſhall ye have.</hi> And <hi>Deut.</hi> 25.13. There is to the ſame purpoſe; I know, that a <hi>caveat emptor</hi> is a Salvo to the ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pid and ſeared conſcience of many a Seller; I, but the Apoſtle gives him another caveat, that he muſt obſerve, or elſe the other will not ſerve his turn. You have it, 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 4.6. <hi>That no man go beyond, or defraud his brother in any matter, for the Lord is the avenger of all ſuch.</hi> It may be, the man whom thou defraudeſt in thy dealings with, is not able to right himſelf upon thee, and therefore muſt put up the wrong that thou haſt done him; I, but God will not: No, he will avenge it, unleſs prevented by a timely repentance, in which, thou muſt not forget, to make reſtitution and ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, according to thine ability.</p>
                  <p>Thus I have finiſhed my diſcourſe upon the firſt cardinal virtue. And therefore, briefly of the</p>

                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, is rendred here, by our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours, as alſo, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.23. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.6. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore (though I find it otherwiſe expreſſed, in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers forreign Tranſlations) yet I ſhall not quit our own; and the rather, becauſe I humbly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, that the deſign of the Apoſtle was not only to lop of a luxuriant branch of incontinency in his Auditor, but alſo to ſtrike at the root, from whence that branch did ſprout; and further, to implant a contrary fundamental virtue in him, that would produce better fruit; for (if I miſtake
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:62437:121"/>not, from hence ſprings chaſtity, righteouſneſs, moderation, clemency, ſelf-denial, meekneſs, ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briety, and ſuch like. He that is temperate, is endued with all theſe virtues: For temperance is nothing elſe, but a kind of Lordſhip, which man exerciſeth over himſelf, ſubjecting himſelf, and all his paſſions and affections to right reaſon. When rectified reaſon is in power, and keeps the reins ſtreight in her hand; then the affections and paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons become regular in their motions, and thoſe motions may paſs under the title of diſtinct vertues; but if ſo, what ſhall we call the oppoſite, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary motions of mans paſſions and affections, but ſo many diſtinct vices? at leaſt, give to every one the black title of Intemperance, even thoſe very <hi>impetus primo primi,</hi> the firſt riſings of original cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, and the leaſt degree of luſt and will, that is not conform to the rule of right reaſon, and curb'd thereby, is ſinful and intemperate; not only, when the deſire is enlarged, as Hell; but alſo, when it is any wayes inordinate: However, I am certain, that none can, with any colour of reaſon, deny, but thoſe belluine, and beaſtly luſts of the fleſh, Drunkenneſs, Gluttony, Fornication, Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery, and ſuch like, may very well paſs under the notion of intemperance: For as the actions of theſe do not at all conform to the rule of right reaſon, ſo they have the ſame names given to them (in Scripture) that the bruits have; for the truth is, they do unman themſelves; and as it is recorded of <hi>Eli</hi>'s ſons, They made themſelves vile and contemptible: Yea, ſo much the more vile, becauſe that they take ſo much care to ſatisfie their
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:62437:121"/>luſts; and ſo little to ſave their immortal Souls. But oh, that we could weep over ſuch, as one once did,<note place="margin">Pambus.</note> when he ſaw an Harlot dreſſing and trimming her ſelf, with her comb, and her glaſs, upon a double con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration. Firſt, becauſe ſhe took ſo much care to undo her Soul; and ſecondly, becauſe he took ſo little care, in providing for his own. For this is an undoubted truth, and the Apoſtle tells us ſo much in the Text. That</p>
                  <p n="2">2. There is a future judgement, a judgement to come; and this is the motive which the Apoſtle makes uſe of, both to dehort his Auditor from Vice, and alſo to preſs him to the practice of Virtue. And ſo I paſs from explication, to Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication.</p>
                  <p>I have already, according to my Text, preſented you with a chequer table, and diſcovered the black of Vice, that all muſt ſhun and avoid, together with the white of Virtue, which all ought to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue in their reſpective ſphears and ſtations. All therefore, that the time will ſuffer me to do, is to hand out a coal from the Text, and to convey a quickning beam from the Sun of truth, that ſhines therein: 'Tis this, Be righteous in your Sphear, and temperate in your Spirits and actings; for there is a future Judgement, wherein God will call you to an account. 'Tis reported of <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> that he enforced all the <hi>Roman</hi> Knights, to give an account of their lives; ſure I am, God will. <hi>We muſt all</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.10.) <hi>ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear before the judgement-ſeat of Chriſt, that every one may receive the things done in the body.</hi> Mark this,
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:62437:122"/>we muſt all appear; for no man is either above, or paſt Judgement: No! They that ſit in Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon others, muſt come to Judgement; And they that take an account, muſt give an account; and they that paſs the ſentence of Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon others here, muſt receive a Sentence themſelves above; for with God, there is no reſpect of perſons in Judgement. All men, of what degree and rank ſoever, will be divided into two ſorts, Sheep and Goats; with a <hi>venite benedicti,</hi> to the one; and an <hi>ite maledicti,</hi> to the other. If the former be your Sentence, then you ſhall enter into your Maſters joy: but if the latter; then nothing but horrour, and trembling, weeping, and wailing, and gnaſhing of teeth, in that lake, that burns with fire and brimſtone for ever. And therefore, I ſhall ſay to all here preſent, as the Apoſtle doth, 2 <hi>Corinths</hi> 5.11. <hi>Knowing the terrour of the Lord, we perſwade men, to flee from the wrath to come.</hi> For neither Riches, nor Honours, nor Garments, No! nor Mountains, can ſhelter, or profit you in that day. Nothing but righteouſneſs, will deliver from death; and without queſtion, it was the appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion and belief of this, that made guilty <hi>Felix</hi> tremble; or, as the <hi>Syrian</hi> hath it, fill'd him with fear: As the earth fill'd with vapours, trembles and quakes, ſo this made an earth quake in his conſcience; as the Hand-writing upon the wall, did in carouſing <hi>Belſhazzars;</hi> a ſign that Fear was in its height and reing. <hi>The ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners in Sion, are afraid</hi> (ſaith the Prophet, <hi>Eſay</hi> 33.14.) <hi>fearfulneſs hath ſurprized the hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrite;</hi>
                     <pb n="217" facs="tcp:62437:122"/>and why ſo? <hi>Who among us ſhall dwell with the devouring fire? Who among us ſhall dwell with everlaſting burnings?</hi> For I can aſſure you, that Hell is no painted Fire, nor like the crackling of thorns under a pot, that make a blaze, but is ſoon extinct: No! the element of Fire, is but a dark and ſhadowy reſemblance of Hell-fire. For, as it is far more tormenting, ſo it is everlaſting; and that adds to the miſery of that Soul, that muſt endure it. Oh, when the Soul muſt be alwayes ſuffering, and yet never ſatisfie; and alwayes dying, and yet never die; this muſt needs be intolerable. And therefore, I do moſt humbly beſeech all guilty perſons, to conſider this, and ſeriouſly to lay it to heart; that you may tremble ſo here, as not to tremble hereafter; and ſo to repent here, as you may not repent when it is too late. And in particular, give me leave, to make my addreſs to all you that are concern'd in the work of the day: And I do as earneſtly beg it of you, that no cauſe may be pleaded at either of the Bars here, but that which may have an Advocate in the Judgement to come; and that thoſe things, and nothing elſe, may be Preſented and Endicted, but what will be preſentable in the Judgement to come; and that if poſſible, no Bill may be found, but that which will be found to be a <hi>Billa vera</hi> in the Judgement to come: And that none of you do take an Oath, but that which will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to have been taken in Truth, Judgement, and Righteouſneſs, in the Judgement to come: And laſt of all, that no Evidence be given, either in Civil, or Criminal cauſes, but ſuch as
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:62437:123"/>will have the teſtimony of a good Conſcience, in the Judgement to come: For elſe, even in this life; when a Lecture ſhall be read to you of Righteouſneſs, Temperance, and Judgement to come, you may be brought to tremble; for ſo was <hi>Felix:</hi> As you have it in the Text, <hi>As</hi> S. <hi>Paul reaſoned of Righteouſneſs, Temperance, and Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to come,</hi> Felix <hi>trembled.</hi>

                  <head>To the truly Honoured Barnaby Bowtel, Of <hi>Parham Haſta,</hi> Eſq; With Madam <hi>MAGDALEN</hi> his Lady, Grace and Peace.</head>
                  <p>THe preaching of the Sermon, which I here preſent you with, and the choice of the Text preached on, at the Funeral of Mr. <hi>Francis Bowtel,</hi> your deceaſed Father, were (as you inform me) his dying Requeſts, and conceived in his Breaſt ſome time before: But had the choice of the Preacher, and the Text been left to me, I ſhould have choſen a <hi>Newcomen,</hi> or an <hi>Harris</hi> for the Preacher, <hi>And know you not that a great man is fallen this day in Iſrael,</hi> for the Text.</p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:62437:126"/>
                  <p>The Task was ſo much the harder, and more difficult for me to undertake, becauſe confined to ſo little time, at ſo great a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, in the depth of Winter, in a croud of Buſineſs, and alſo having never preached on the Text before. But <hi>verba morientis</hi>— his Deſires were as Commands to me; and therefore ſince it was, as it was, I muſt humbly beg of you, to receive the Sermon as it is, without emendation or correction.</p>
                  <p>The Reaſon why I refuſed to print it, when deſired by one, or both of you, was; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe then I was utterly averſe to that work: but now being drawn thereunto, I cannot but account my ſelf obliged to conjoyn this with ſome others, that I may lie no longer under the cenſure of Ingratitude, and alſo, that the memory of ſo worthy and remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able a Perſon, may be revived and perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuated.</p>
                  <p>I know, that Funeral Sermons, are (moſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly) made but matters of form, and men come to them, as to a great Feaſt. The firſt courſe, wherein God is moſt concern'd, is lightly paſſed over: The ſecond, wherein Man is repreſented, is (commonly) moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, and ſtood upon: but herein I was prevented, and 'tis like, did fruſtrate the expectation of my Auditors; partly, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
<pb facs="tcp:62437:126"/>of my ſhort acquaintance with him; and partly, that I might not give an alarm to my own people at home, and provoke their Spirits to accuſe me of partiality in ſerving them up with the firſt, without the ſecond; even at the Funerals of ſome perſons of great worth, for true Piety and Godlineſs. And yet I hope without offence, I may take liberty to write that of him now, which I did not then ſpeak. As to his natural Pedigree, I ſhall not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern my ſelf, nor the Reader with it, for his ſpiritual is chiefly in mine eye, as that which ſpeaks him to be one of the remarkable men in the Text, whilst living, and dying; for thoſe that knew him better then my ſelf, cannot but ſay this of him, that he was a Perfect and an <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pright man. He had the external form of Godlineſs, and a name to live: for, as he was a conſtant attendant upon publick Ordinances of Divine Worſhip, where he could enjoy them, and whilſt in health and ſtrength; ſo his Geſture and Behaviour therein was reverent and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, ſuited to their nature and kind. His Speech was ſeaſoned with Salt, that it might adminiſter Grace to the Hearer. Yea, (as I have been informed) when he went forth to take an overſight of Servants and Day-Labourers, or when he met with poor people
<pb facs="tcp:62437:127"/>in his way, he would be ſpeaking to them of the things of God, and that which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned their eternal peace; A rare Practice in a Gentleman. As to the Education of his Children, and bringing them up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord, I hope, that the ſobriety, temperance, and gracefulneſs of yours (Dear Sir) and your Siſters Lives, are the genuine fruits thereof; and yet this is not all. For to the outward form (without queſtion) there was the inward power. He was nobly deſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, being born again, not of Bloud, nor of the will of the Fleſh, nor of the will of Man, but of God: Yea, ſtampt with the Divine Image, made partaker of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Nature, and richly adorned, and beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified with the gifts and graces of Gods holy Spirit: So that he did not act meerly from external motives, but from internal prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, that could not be hid; and hence it was, that he was filled with the fruits of Righteouſneſs, and like a Tree planted by the Rivers of water, bringing forth his fruit in due ſeaſon: Or rather a Tree plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Houſe of the Lord, and flouriſhing in the Courts of our God, ſtill bringing forth fruit in old age, ſo that his Gray Hairs were a Crown of Glory to him, being found in the way of Righteouſneſs.</p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:62437:127"/>
                  <p>He lived about ninety ſix years a natural life, began the very day of his Death in Sabbath-work, and finiſhed the work of his Natural Life with the ending of the day, and ſo went to his eternal reſt, in the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom of his dear Jeſus; he lay down, and ſlept in the Lord. But, as he did not live (though he lived long) undeſired, ſo he did not dye unlamented; witneſs the Throng and Concourſe of ſerious Chriſtians, that accompanied his Corps to the Church, where his Body was interr'd, and laid to reſt, (and that in ſharp weather, in a bitter Even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing) with a ſilent and grave deportment, as true Spiritual Mournerrs are wont to do, at the Funeral of ſome eminent and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable man. <hi>Leves loquuntur, ingentes ſtupent</hi>—</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Honoured,</hi> My deſign is not to renew your grief, on the one hand, nor to flatter you on the other, but to be your Remembrancer, and to put you in mind of thoſe things which you know, and are well aſſured of, being Eye, and Ear-witneſſes thereof, that you may be ſtirred up to make a right uſe of his holy Example and Copy, which he left behind him, and with you in particular, to imitate and write after. So ſhall you approve your ſelves to be of the number of the remarkable

                  <p>COſmographers divide the inhabitable world into ſundry, and many parts, and tell us, that of thoſe many, the feweſt are thoſe that own the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Religion, or the name of a Chriſt: but alaſs! how few of theſe, are the men, we find in my Text, <hi>perfect and upright men?</hi> the heap of chaff, is far greater than the wheat; and the number of <hi>Briſtol,</hi> or pebbles ſtones, far greater then of Pearls and Diamonds. Chriſts flock is a very little, little flock (as the <hi>Greek</hi> expreſſeth it, <hi>Luk.</hi> 12.32.) <hi>Many are called, but few are choſen, Matth.</hi> 20.16. Caſt out the groſly ignorant, the practical Atheiſt, the debauched and prophane, ſuch as have made a covenant with death, and are at an agreement with hell, that can drink and whore, ſwear, and bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpheme the Sacred Name of God, prophane his Sabbaths, contemn his Ordinances, caſt his Law behind their backs, and hate to be accounted ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious

                  <p n="1">1. <hi>To Mark;</hi> The <hi>Hebrew</hi> word <hi>(Shamar)</hi> in its Primitive ſignification, ſignifies to keep or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve one from danger; And therefore, a Noun, coming from this Verb, ſignifies a watch-tower, a place to deſcry a danger for prevention of it: Now becauſe it is the duty of a watch-man, that is ſet in a watch-tower, to obſerve all commers and goers, enemies as well as friends; I, and to be very diligent and accurate in his obſervation of them: Therefore I conceive, the Holy Ghoſt is pleaſed to make uſe of this word, here in our Text; For ſuch a kind of obſervation we ought to make of the perfect, and upright man, that a watchman ſhould, of all commers and goers near the watch-tower. We ſhould be very accute herein, as of a matter of great concern; a ſlight thought of him is not ſufficient. No! we ſhould take ſpecial no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of him, as a perſon moſt remarkable; <hi>mark the perfect man.</hi>

                  <p n="2">2. As we ſhould mark him, ſo we muſt behold him; <hi>Mark and Behold;</hi> The latter word imports more then the former; For, in the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage it ſignifies, ſometimes, to behold an object with pleaſure, delight, and admiration; as per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons exceedingly taken, and taken up with the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject; and ſo here, for there are many that will very accutely and exactly <hi>Mark and obſerve the perfect and upright man;</hi> I, and watch him too, in all his motions and actings, as far as they can: I, but they
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:62437:130"/>watch and obſerve him with an evil eye; Not with any pleaſure or delight in him; Not with an eye of approbation, but with an eye of reproba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; Not with an eye of admiration, but with an eye of deteſtation; not with an eye of imitation, but with an eye of malediction; unleſs he chance to trip and ſtumble in his way; and then, they make no better uſe of it, then this: they that were careleſs and remiſs before, in obſerving, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding themſelves in reference to their own ſinful ways, grow more careleſs and remiſs after, until they become paſt recovery, and eternally wrapt up in miſery, unleſs grace prevents. Such watchmen there are in the world, but they do not obſerve the watchword in the Text; for that is of another import: and certainly it muſt needs be great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice, to fix an evil eye upon one, whom the holy Ghoſt is pleaſed to ſet forth, under two glorious and admirable titles, as are expreſſed in the Text. The object is no contemptible object: but a rare and ſoul taking object. The Holy Ghoſt doth not ſet thee to feed thy eye, and thy ſoul with a meer ſhadow, a low and empty thing: but with that which may afford thee a due, and fit object of ſoul-contemplation.</p>

And yet, when we have both the expreſſions, in one text, as here, we muſt diſtinguiſh the ſenſe: for it is not a tautologie: And therefore, ſaith a Divine of ours, the former may be taken for inward ſoundneſs, the latter for outward juſtice and equity, reſpecting a mans dealings in the world, or in two words, a perfect man, is a plain hearted man; and an up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right man, is a plain dealing man: in the one, you may mark, and behold, the holineſs and grace of his heart, in the other, the holineſs of his life; and both are to be marked and beheld, with much accuteneſs of obſervation, joyned with admiration and delight.</p>

A Perfection of Juſtification: and in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect all true believers are compleatly perfect, <hi>i. e.</hi> They are perfectly juſtified: So <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.14. <hi>By one offering he</hi> (<hi>i.e.</hi> Chriſt) <hi>hath perfected for ever them that are ſanctified.</hi> And <hi>Col.</hi> 2.10. <hi>And ye are compleat in him.</hi> 'Tis true in themſelves they are incompleat and imperfect: but in Chriſt they are compleat and perfect: in themſelves ſinners, but in Chriſt righteous.

<pb n="226" facs="tcp:62437:131"/>perſons through Chriſt, who is righteous, looks upon them, as righteous, their ſin is charg'd upon him; and his righteouſneſs is imputed unto them: So ſaith the Apoſtle, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.21. <hi>He was made ſin for us, that we might be made the righteouſneſs of God in him.</hi> So that God looks not upon a true believer, as a ſinner, but as righteous, for he looks upon him, in him, that for his ſake, was made a ſinner, not by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haeſion or tranſgreſſion, but by imputation.</p>

                  <p>As a child that hath all the parts of a man, may be ſaid to be a perfect child, although it be not grown up to the age, and ſtature of a man: So a Child of God, that hath all the ſaving and ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying graces of Gods Spirit, and the lines of his im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age drawn upon him, may be ſaid to be perfect, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he is not yet come to his full age, and growth in grace; ſuch a one is fundamentally per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, although he is not complementally perfect; grace is glory inchoate, and glory is grace conſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate; As ſoon as ever a man becomes a new man, he is a young glory, although he be not complemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally glorious: yea, he is ſuch a glory, and ſo perfect in glory, at the firſt, that he is worthy of our due ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation; and a fit object of contemplation with great delight, and admiration. <hi>Mark the perfect man and behold the upright:</hi> obſerve him accurately, and throughly; yea, fix the eye of your ſouls upon him intenſly, and with the greateſt delight, pleaſure, and admiration, that you can.</p>
                  <p>Thus I have opened the firſt part of my text,
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:62437:131"/>and ſhall reſolve it into this propoſition.</p>
                  <p>That a perfect and upright man, is a remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able man, worthy of a delightful contemplation; or thus, a godly man is a taking object; there is much in him to take the heart, and feed the eyes of men with delight, and pleaſure. And indeed, next to God, Chriſt, and the Holy Spirit, he is the moſt taking the moſt delightful object: the whole world affords not the like: in that reſpect, he is a none ſuch. I, what though he be never ſo poor in the world, that he hath ſcarce a rag to cover his nakedneſs, or a piece of bread to put into his mouth, or an houſe to put his head in: yet for all this, he is a taking object; for I may ſay of him, as our Saviour of the Lillies, <hi>that</hi> Solomon, <hi>in all his glory, was not arrayed like one of theſe.</hi> So the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt perſon upon the earth, in all his outward glory and ſplendour, if he be deſtitute of true grace, is not cloathed as one of theſe; all his beauty is but defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity: his greatneſs but meanneſs, &amp; his riches but poverty; the righteous, ſaith <hi>Solomon, is more excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent then his neighbor.</hi> I, though the neighbor be never ſo great in the world? 'tis grace that renders a man truly excellent, and truly honourable. For,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Look upon him as to his pedigree and birth, and ſee from whence he came, and you muſt needs take him for a great and noble perſonage; So <hi>John</hi> 1.13. <hi>born not of blood</hi> (or, as in the Original, <hi>not of bloods</hi>) <hi>nor of the will of man, but of God.</hi> Many men boaſt, and brag much of their parentage, and the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily or houſe they came out of. Such a Duke, ſuch a Lord, ſuch a great perſon was their Father, or Grandfather, and ſuch a great perſon is their bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, or their uncle or near allies. But alas, what is
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:62437:132"/>this to a mans being born from above, to come out of the family of heaven, to have God for thy Father, and Chriſt for thy Brother, and near ally? the other is not to be named with this. No, were thy earthly parents beggars from door to door, and thou born naturally upon a dunghil, yet if thou haſt God for thy Spiritual Father, thou art more nobly deſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, then all the great ones in the world, if they are not born from above, as well as from beneath. I tell thee thy relation ſpeaks thee noble and honorable.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Look upon him as to his education and breed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and ſee how he is diſciplined and trained up, and you muſt needs be taken therewith. He is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable for that there are many that will boaſt of their breeding, if not of their birth; And indeed, there is as much to be conſidered in that, if not more, then in the other. And therefore <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great, thought himſelf as much bound to his Tutor, as to his Father; becauſe the one gave him his being, but the other his well-being; the one was the inſtrument of life, and the other fitted him to live in the world. Why Beloved, a godly man hath not only the beſt birth, but the beſt breeding, for as he is born of God, ſo he is taught of God. Whoever is the uſher or ſub-tutor, God is the Maſter-teacher; So <hi>John</hi> 6.45. It is written in the Prophets; <hi>And they ſhall be all taught of God;</hi> And 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 4.9. <hi>Ye are taught of God to love one another.</hi> Now if God undertakes the work, it muſt needs be admirably well done; thoſe muſt needs be well taught, that have God for their teacher; for as he teacheth men the beſt things that can be taught, and learnt: ſo he teacheth them in the beſt way that can be uſed; not only in the beſt method,
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:62437:132"/>but alſo with the greateſt efficacy and power; he makes them ſuch, as he teacheth them to be, and cauſeth them to do that, which he teacheth them to do: And in all, enricheth and ennobleth the minds and ſpirits of his Diſciples, with ſuch kind of learning and knowledge, as is not to be found in the whole world; he makes them all experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Scholars in the great and profound myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of Heaven: So that there is not one in all the world, that can be a match for the meaneſt Scholar in his School: No, take a man that with <hi>Bereuga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius,</hi> is able almoſt to diſpute <hi>de omni ſcibili;</hi> or with <hi>Solomon,</hi> to unravel Nature, from the Cedar to the Hyſſop; yet a poor Soul, in the loweſt form in Gods School, that is taught of him, is able to baffle, and to confound ſuch an one, if once they come to engage in the matters of Heaven. 'Tis very true, Beloved, Humane Learning ought not to be deſpiſed; Humane Arts and Sciences are brave ornaments to the mind, and are very uſeful in many reſpects: I, but not to be compared with divine and heavenly light and knowledge. If Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Learning be as the Ring, Divine Learning is as the Pearl or Diamond in the Ring; and far exceeds it in worth and excellency.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Look upon him as to the complexion of his Soul, and the air of his Countenance. And indeed, as a man may read much of the complexion of another mans Soul in the air of his Countenance; ſo did <hi>Jacob</hi> in <hi>Laban</hi>'s, which put him to the flight: So there is much glory, and beauty in the Soul and Countenance of a godly man. <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith, <hi>Wiſdom makes the face to ſhine;</hi> how much more doth it make the Soul to ſhine, for that is
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:62437:133"/>the ſeat thereof. Mark that of the Apoſtle, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.18. <hi>We all, with open face, beholding as in a glaſs, the glory of the Lord, are changed into the ſame image.</hi> Now if there be beauty and glory in the Original, there muſt needs be beauty and glory in the Copy; elſe the Copy will not be any wayes anſwerable to the Original. And therefore, ſaith Chriſt to his Church, <hi>Cant.</hi> 2.14. <hi>Let me hear thy voice, and ſee thy countenance, for pleaſant is thy voice, and thy countenance is comely.</hi> Yea, he is ſo taken therewith, that it puts him, as it were into a rapture, it raviſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth his Soul, or takes away his Heart, as the <hi>Hebrew</hi> ſignifies, <hi>Cant.</hi> 4.9. And indeed a gracious Soul, is a lovely and amiable Soul; the greateſt beauty in the world. She ſtands not in need of a black patch, to ſet her off, or to commend her to others.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Look upon a godly man, as to his life and converſation, and you muſt needs ſay, that he is very remarkable; for he is one, that walks with God, in the way of God, even in that way, that leads to the fulleſt fruition, and enjoyment of God: Nay, he is one, that lives the life that God lives, in ſome meaſure; for he lives a life of holineſs, and that is the life that God lives. 'Tis true, he lives on the Earth, but his converſation is in Heaven, where his God and his Treaſure is: Yea, 'tis true, he lives in Fleſh, but not after the Fleſh; for whilſt he lives in Fleſh, he lives in the Spirit, and walks in the Spirit; and ſo turns the life of Nature, into a life of Grace. Now the more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent the life of any being is, the more remarkable and admirable is that being. What is it, that ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders an Angel ſo admirable, but becauſe he lives an Angelical life. And what is it, that advanceth a
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:62437:133"/>man above a beaſt, but becauſe he lives a better life, then a beaſt doth. I ſpeak now, of men that live like men, and not like bruits; and ſo, that advanceth a godly man, above all other men; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he lives a better life then others do. The life of Reaſon, is better then the life of Senſe; but the life of Grace and Religion is far better then the life of Reaſon. Had I but time to ſet it forth in ſome particular inſtances, this demonſtration would carry a ſtrong conviction with it, into the hearts of any unbyaſſed hearers, and cauſe them to confeſs, that none upon the face of the earth, live ſuch honourable and noble lives as Saints do. Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs of life is a conformity to the moſt noble and honourable Rule, even the law of the Spirit of Life in Chriſt Jeſus. Holineſs of life, is a conformity to the moſt noble and honourable pattern. Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of life is the power and virtue of Chriſt, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed to the life; 'tis the Divine nature mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted in Humane fleſh, 'tis the Spirit of God, breathing through corporal acts. Holineſs of life, is the admiration of Angels, the joy and delight of the eternal God: (he taketh pleaſure in his Saints) and therefore muſt needs be a taking object; 'tis very true, 'tis a great Paradox and Riddle to the men of the world: For it is ſimplicity, without foolery; 'tis gravity, without moroſeneſs; 'tis humility, without will-worſhip; 'tis ſingularity, without affectation; 'tis reſervedneſs, without narrowneſs and ſtreightneſs of ſpirit; 'tis an holy freedom and liberty, without licenciouſneſs; meekneſs, without cowardize; ſtoutneſs and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of Spirit, without pride and cruelty; patient for God, but impatient againſt ſin; a ſufferer in its
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:62437:134"/>own cauſe, but a warriour in Chriſts; a death unto ſin and the world, but a new life unto righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, and unto God. The man dies to all things here below, that are ſinful, vain and tranſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, and lives unto things above: Nay, which is the moſt to be admired in him, is this; that a Saints life is not only croſs, and contrary to the life and converſation of wicked and ungodly men; but ever when others are worſt, then he labours to be beſt. Thee have I ſeen righteous, ſaith God to <hi>Noah;</hi> I, the worſe they grow, the better he labours to be; like the glow-worm, that ſhines brighteſt in a dark night. Then <hi>Daniel</hi> opened his window, when Prayer to the true God, was decried, and by the moſt reſtrained. Then did <hi>Elijah</hi> plead for God, when almoſt the whole Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion were for <hi>Baal,</hi> and <hi>Baals</hi> Prophets were 450; here was great odds between them, and yet the Prophets holy zeal carried him through his under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking, until he ſaw a good ſucceſs thereof. Holineſs of heart and life, hath ever carried away the Bell, and Crown at laſt: And therefore, well might the Pſalmiſt ſay in our Text, <hi>Marke the perfect man, and behold the upright: for the end of that man is peace.</hi> The end of his actings, and the end of his life is peace. And that leads me to a</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Demonſtration of the excellency and admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rableneſs of a godly man, and is the ſecond part of the Text, <hi>viz.</hi> The motive or argument, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with the Pſalmiſt preſſeth and urgeth his exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation and holy injunction. <hi>Mark the perfect man, and behold the upright: for the end of that man is peace.</hi> The <hi>finis cui,</hi> the end for which he is ſet, is for Peace. And the <hi>finis cujus,</hi> his end and wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:62437:134"/>up is Peace. <hi>Arias Montanus</hi> renders it; <hi>The laſt to the man is peace.</hi> 'Tis true, he meets with many a bruſh by the way; in the world, Saints ſhall have trouble on every ſide: none meets with ſo many, all winds blow croſs to him, at one time or another. Sin, Satan, and the World; he is their But and Mark, at which they level all their poiſonous, and deadly Arrows. If an Heathen could ſay, <hi>Nos fuimus Troes, agitamur ventis.</hi> What may not a Saint ſay in this reſpect: Surely as the Prophet, <hi>Eſay</hi> 54.12. <hi>I am afflicted, toſſed with a tempeſt, and not comforted:</hi> Or as the Apoſtle St. <hi>Paul, Without were fightings, within were fears:</hi> Or as the Church, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 128.3. <hi>The plowers plow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon my back, they made long their furrows.</hi> I, but ſtill mark and behold him in all this, look not only to his ſetting out, but to his Journeys end; for though he ſails through rough and rug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged waves, and is oft in danger of ſplitting upon Soul-ruining Rocks, or ſticking in the Sands; yet at laſt he arrives at the Haven of Reſt: <hi>The end of that man is peace.</hi> And it muſt needs be ſo; for as Chriſt hath forewarn'd him of the one, ſo he hath aſſured him of the other, <hi>John</hi> 16.33. <hi>In the world you ſhall have trouble, but in me ye ſhall have peace.</hi> If they han't it, in this life; yet they ſhall not miſs of it, in the life to come: <hi>The end of thoſe men is peace.</hi> The beſt Wine is reſerved for the laſt, and the Crown for the Conqueſt. 'Tis very true, that Grace is given to men here in this life, or elſe 'tis never given: I, but 'tis as true, that if Peace be denied to a gracious Soul in this life; yet it ſhall not be denied to her, in the life to come, <hi>Eſay</hi> 32.17. Though the Soul ſows in tears, all the
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:62437:135"/>time of her abode in the body; yet ſhe ſhall reap in joy, when ſhe hath got her freedom from that priſon. Below ſhe may haply ſpend her daies in mourning; but above, ſhe ſhall ſpend an eternity in ſinging and rejoycing. Here ſhe mourns, and ſighs, and cries, becauſe ſhe is no better; but there ſhe ſhall rejoyce and ſing, becauſe ſhe is ſo well: And indeed, the word <hi>Peace,</hi> is of large extent; it comprehends all the deſires of the Soul of man, even felicity and happineſs to the utmoſt: And therefore the ancient Salutation of the Jews, was Peace; for that is the moſt deſirable thing. Heaven would be no Heaven, if there were no Peace en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyable there: And Hell would be no Hell, if Peace were enjoyable there. Give a man true and ſolid Peace, and you give him Heaven; take Peace from him, and he is in Hell. Holineſs and Wickedneſs, divides the World; and Peace and Trouble, divides the ſtates of men in the world. To the wicked God ſaith, <hi>There is no Peace;</hi> to the godly he ſaith, <hi>The end is Peace.</hi> For,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Then he is above all danger; above the power of Sin, the malice of Men, and the rage of Hell. He hath nothing to trouble, or diſquiet him; no temptations from without, nor from within; he is now ſinleſs, and therefore ſorrowleſs. A godly man goes free into Heaven, and there enjoyes the utmoſt freedom.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Then he is at his Center, and there enjoyes Reſt, and therefore Peace; God is the proper Center of the Soul. And therefore (as the ancient Father hath it) we are not at reſt, until we come to God. I, but when we come to God, then we are at reſt, for then we are in our proper Sphear. <hi>In
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:62437:135"/>thy preſence is fulneſs of joy, and at thy right hand are pleaſures for evermore.</hi> I, joy without ſorrow, and pleaſure without pain; I, and ſuch a fulneſs, as puts an end to all anxious and painful deſires; for in God the Soul enjoyes full, and perfect ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction, without any glut. <hi>When I awake</hi> (ſaith the Pſalmiſt) <hi>I ſhall be ſatisfied with thy likeneſs.</hi> And when the Appetite is ſatisfied, and the Belly filled, we ſay, the Bones are at reſt. Sure I am, when the Soul is full, ſhe is at reſt; here ſhe is in motion, travelling from Duty, to Duty; and from Ordinance, to Ordinance; and from Scripture, to Scripture; and all to get ſomething of God whom ſhe loves, and after whom ſhe breaths: but in Heaven, ſhe is at reſt, for there ſhe is filled with all the fulneſs of God: God is the All, of a gracious Soul here, and there he will be all in all to her, and all in her: The lines of his glory will be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleatly drawn upon her then, and ſhe ſwallowed up in divine embraces, without the leaſt inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption. Alas, Sirs, here you have but a taſte; but there a Saint ſhall ſwim in the Ocean of divine goodneſs and love. This, this is the great end of a perfect and upright man; who is born of God, taught of God, beautified by the indwelling of God, and raiſed up by the power of the Divine Spirit, to a moſt admirable converſe with, and conformity to the life of God; <hi>The end of that man is peace.</hi> As ſoon as ever he enters into the Manſion of Glory, he enters into Peace. (As you have it, <hi>Eſay</hi> 57.2.) And all the time he lodgeth there, he dwells in peace: For though the end of that man is Peace, yet the Peace of that man ſhall never end; the Crown of Life, is a never-fading
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:62437:136"/>Crown; not a Crown of Gold, but of Glory: The Kingdom is an everlaſting Kingdom.</p>
                  <p>Now, Beloved, put all theſe things together, and ſee if a perfect and upright man, be not a remarkable man, and worthy of your obſervation, and delightful contemplation? The truth is, he is oft the worlds wonder; I, but 'tis very certain, he is a perſon of whom the world is not worthy. As you have it, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.38. Not that he hath any worth in, and from himſelf; no, in himſelf he hath nothing that is good. <hi>In my fleſh</hi> (ſaith <hi>Paul</hi>) <hi>there dwells no good.</hi> But as he lives from God, and lives in God, and receives communications from him, he is an admirable piece, next to the man Chriſt Jeſus, he is the Maſter-piece of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Love and Grace. Oh, where is the perſon ſo blind, ſo ſottiſh and mad, as will not be taken with ſuch a man! for ſo are all thoſe, that are not taken with him; but why ſhould we wonder at this? when as there are ſo many that take little or no notice of God, ſo few that fix their eyes upon their maker, ſo few that love him, or take any delight in him. If the Original be ſlighted, no wonder if the Copy be: The Panther bears an implacable enmity and hatred againſt Man, and therefore can't endure the picture of a man; and ſo here, Men by nature are enemies to God, and therefore they hate his Image where ever it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Application.</hi> But O Sirs, let me beg of you, that you will not be of that number: No, but let your hearts fall under the power of this Divine Truth in the Text. <hi>Mark the perfect man, and behold the upright.</hi>

                  <p n="1">1. To admire God in him; for what is the perfection and uprightneſs of any man, but God in the man, working and framing him to ſuch a gracious temper in his heart and life? I tell you, if you do admire the goodneſs and grace of any man, and do not at that time, look upon God as the fountain and efficient thereof, you do but ſet up an Idol: No, God is the all, and the do-all in the man; and therefore he, and he alone is to be admired. Oh, when you ſee the man in the Text, ſay, God is in the man; and therefore I am taken with him.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. To mark and obſerve him ſo, as to imitate him, as far as he is imitable.

<pb n="238" facs="tcp:62437:137"/>to be marked for our imitation, and Copy, after which we ſhould write; For you can never be like him in his end, unleſs you be ſomewhat like him in his beginning and progreſs. You muſt not only deſire with <hi>Balaam,</hi> that you may die the death of the righteous, but you muſt alſo live the life the righteous; you muſt be perfect and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right ones, or elſe your end will not be Peace. This eternal Crown will not be ſet upon any mans head, but upon his that hath run the race of Goſpel-perfection and uprightneſs, and finiſhed his courſe; doth not only begin, but holds out to the laſt: For the Text tells us, that 'tis he, and he only, whoſe end and laſt, or winding up, ſhall be Peace. <hi>Mark the perfect man, and behold the upright: for the end of that man is Peace.</hi>
